# Discussion {#sec:discussion}

The study aimed to explore the relationship between self-reported sleepiness scores, as measured by the KSS, and neural markers of drowsiness measured in the KDT across a sample of people with insomnia, non-restorative sleep, and healthy controls. 

### KSS score variance 

The study found that KSS scores varied across groups. 

### AAC

This is how AAC scores correlated amongst 3 groups

### Slowing Ratio

Here I will talk about slowing ratio

### Topographic electrode cluster differences between ID/NRS

Topographic power spectral analysis found these cluster differences which mean this

## Strengths

- Age and sex matching of participants
- Strong exclusion criteria

## Limitations

- Sample size

## Practical implications and future directions 

## Conclusion

# APA formatted thesis for rMarkdown

## Why use markdown/rstudio

This took me ages to work out. Beyond "it's just better", being able to use version control is genuinely helpful. 
Version control on Git means that you have all the previous copies of your documents saved, and you can look back at them at any time.

## Structure

The master doc is the one you use to knit the whole thing together. 
Each smaller file is included there, and you can turn them on or off by changing the code from =true to =false

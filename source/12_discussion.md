### Summary

This study aimed to examine the differences in brain activity during resting wake upon awakening between a small group of age and sex matched individuals with non-restorative sleep, insomnia disorder, and healthy controls. 
It did not find any significant differences in self-assessed state sleepiness scores as measured by the KSS between groups or EEG markers of drowsiness calculated through SR or AAC, however there was a significant difference in normalised theta activity between the ID and NRS groups when adding self-assessed sleepiness as a covariate. 
 KSS scores were additionally not correlated with any significant clusters of electrodes for SR or AAC after adjustment for multiple comparisons across any groups.  




## Strengths

- Age and sex matching of participants
- Strong exclusion criteria

## Limitations

- Sample size

## Practical implications and future directions

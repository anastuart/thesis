# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

I would like to thank my primary supervisor, Dr Rick Wassing. The incredible learning opportunities and support that I have experienced this year have been invaluable. I have learned more than I could have imagined and enjoyed every minute of it. 
Additional thanks to Dr Julia Chapman and Associate Professor Chris Gordon, who have acted as additional supervisors and mentors, and been forthcoming with their encouragement, feedback, and guidance. 
Further thanks to all the staff at the Woolcock. Thanks to Samer, Garry, Francis, and Jack, who showed me immense kindness at the start of the year and showed me how interesting sleep research could be. I would not have had this opportunity without you, and I am incredibly grateful. 
Ciara, Gil, and Lucy, I could not have asked for a better group of people to go through this year with. Thank you for all the late-night answers to my questions and for the constant companionship. 

I could not have done this without the love and encouragement of my friends, who supported me throughout this year even when I went missing for weeks at a time. I can't thank you all, but I am so blessed. Loz, thank you for the thousands of hours on the phone and endless pep talks. Angus, thank you for showing me that sleep was the coolest thing ever. 

To my family, who have supported me every time I have big dreams and believing in me when I don't believe in myself. I will never be able to put into words how much your faith in me during this journey has meant. Max, thank you for always making me laugh and taking my mind off things when I was stressed. Genie, you showed me how to work hard even when it's hard. Grandpa, thank you for believing in me. Mum and Dad, you taught me to always follow my passions, and that work should be something that you truly care about.

I would not be here without the support of everyone who has gotten me to this point, and I am filled with gratitude for everything that this project has brought for me. Thank you.

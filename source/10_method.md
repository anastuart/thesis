## Procedure

Participants were recruited through referrals from the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research and the Royal Prince Alfred sleep clinics, in addition to social media advertising. The Woolcock Institute is a specialist sleep and respiratory disorders clinic that conducts research in addition to clinical services for individuals experiencing a sleep disorder. Volunteers completed an online questionnaire to assess eligibility for inclusion in a clinical group (ID, NRS, healthy controls) which was then confirmed through telephone screening by a researcher and an in-person clinincal screening by a sleep physician. 

 Participants attended the sleep laboratory at the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research for initial screening by a sleep physician. Participants baseline sleep and activity patterns were measured via an Actigraphy watch (**which one**) for 7 days prior, which was validated against self-reported sleep diaries [@menczelschrire2023]. Participants additionally completed the Restorative Sleep Questionnaire Daily Version (RSQ-D) to assess baseline sleep quality [@drake2014]. 

Upon arrival at the laboratory at 17:00, participants underwent a final medical screening and a series of cognitive assessments that formed part of a larger study. They were then served dinner and fitted with a high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) cap. Participants went to bed at their habitual bedtime, as established by self-report and actigraphy data [@schrire2022]. 

Overnight PSG data were collected using standard American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) clinical practice guidelines, measuring EEG activity, in addition to electrocardiogram (ECG), electrooculogram (EOG), electromyogram (EMG), respiratory effort, nasal airflow, thermistor, snore sensor, body position, and oxygen saturation [@berry2017]. Any overnight disturbances were recorded by research staff. 

Lights were turned on at the participant's natural wake time and they were asked if they were already awake or wakened by researchers. The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) and Karolinska Drowsiness Test (KDT) was administered five minutes post habitual wake time. Following the morning KDT, participants completed further cognitive testing and an MRI scan.

Participants were reimbursed for travel costs to and from the laboratory up to the value of $250, and remunerated $100 upon successful completion of the study.  

## Participants

The study was approved by the Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee (FoRA ID 17112) and all participants provided written informed consent. Participation was voluntary and could be discontinued at any time.

The present study was derived from data captured from a larger neuroimaging research study on phenotyping of patients with NRS. Due to the complexity of the study and large amount of outcome variables an ad-hoc power analysis was not completed. A sample size of 12 participants from each clinical population, with a total sample of 36 participants, was proposed due to funding constraints. Due to the time limitations of an honours thesis, the final sample obtained was 33 participants (13 NRS; 11 ID; 9 Controls).

Due to the influence of age and sex on sleep architecture, participants were sex and age matched with a maximum difference ± 2 years [@mongrain2005]. 

Participants were excluded if they had any comorbid sleep apnoea, as measured by WristOX pulse oximiter which has a high sensitivity of diagnosing obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome [@nigro2009]. Participants were additionally excluded if they had clinically significant depression or anxiety scores as measured through the DASS-21, heavy alcohol use, pregnancy, circadian rhythm disruption through shift work or recent international travel, or a natural sleep time that of less than 6 hours or outside the hours of 21:30 and 8:00. As medications are known to affect sleep architecture, participants taking regular medications affecting sleep were excluded. 

The inclusion criteria for the ID group was as set by the DSM-5-TR criteria, with difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep persisting for over 1 month causing clinically significant distress or impairment in daily life, as diagnosed by a sleep physician [@americanpsychiatricassociation2022]. They additionally were required to have a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6 or higher, and an Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score of 16 or higher.

Individuals in the NRS group could not have a mean Total Sleep Time (TST) below six hours as measured by sleep diary or actigraphy, or a mean refreshed score above 3. Inclusion in this group required a PSQI of 6 or more, with subcomponent scores of at least 2 on the PSQI Component 1 and 10 on PSQI Component 5. 

Healthy controls needed to have a PSQI score of 4 or less and an ISI score of 6 or less.

## Measures

### Screening questionnaire

- sex, age, alcohol consumption, pregnancy and MRI, shift work, stop-bang, ISI
 dass-21, PSQI, ISI

Demographic questions were administered online to assess eligibility (appendix A). 

### ISI

Insomnia symptoms were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a seven item self-report measure of subjective insomnia symptoms [@bastien2001]. Items (e.g. "Please rate the CURRENT (i.e. LAST 2 WEEKS) SEVERITY of your insomnia problem(s)") are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 ("none") to 4 ("very severe"). 
The scale ranges from 0 to 28, with scores of 10 or greater found to have 86.1% sensitivity and 87.7% specificity for detecting ID cases in a community sample and ISI scores ≥ 15 interpreted as moderate-severe insomnia [@morin2011].
The ISI demonstrated good internal consistency within the sample with a Cronbach's alpha of .89. 

### PSQI

Self-assessed sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a 19-item questionnaire assessing sleep quality and disturbance over the past month [@bussye1989]. 
The PSQI measures a broader construct than insomnia severity as it measures a broader range of sleep-related disturbances beyond sleep initiation and maintenance. The convergent validity between the PSQI and ISI within our sample was r = .79.
The measure produces a global score (PSQI) comprised of seven component scores, relating to subjective sleep quality (PSQI-1), sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances (PSQI-5), use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. 
Items are rated on a four point Likert scale with greater scores indicating greater impairment. 
Global PSQI scores range from 0 to 21, with scores ≥ 5 recommended as the cut-off point for poor quality sleep in clinical populations  [@bussye1989].
NRS participants were required to have a PSQI-1 ("During the past month, how would you rate your sleep quality overall") subjective sleep quality score ≥ 2 ("fairly bad" or "very bad") and PSQI-5 ("During the past month, how often have you had trouble sleeping because you...") sleep disturbance component scores ≥ 10.
The PSQI demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (α=.72) within the sample, which is consistent with previously reported values in clinical and non-clinical populations [@mollayeva2016].

### DASS-21 (can I scrap this for space?)

To control for clinically significant comorbid depression or anxiety, the short form Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was administered during the recruitment stage [@lovibond1995].
The 21-item self-report scale is comprised of three 7-item subscales measuring depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms over the prevous week on a 4-point likert scale from 0 ("did not apply to me at all") to 3 ("applied to me very much, or most of the time"). Scale scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating incresed depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms. T
The scale had acceptable internal consistency for the depression (α=.74) and anxiety (α=.79) subscales, but unacceptable internal consistency for the stress (α = .21) subscale. As only the depression and anxiety scores were used to screen for comorbidity, the scale demonstrated acceptable reliability for the dimensions of interest. 

### Flinders Fatigue Scale

Daytime fatigue impairments was measured using the Flinders Fatigue Scale (FFS), a 7-item measure of fatigue characteristics (e.g. "was fatigue a problem for you") over the previous two weeks [@gradisar2007]. 
The scale produces a score ranging from 0 to 31, with greater scores indicating greater fatigue. 
The scale explicitly defines fatigue as being distinct from sleepiness, stating “We are interested in the extent that you have felt **fatigued** (tired, weary, exhausted) over the last **two weeks**. We **do not** mean feelings of **sleepiness** (the likelihood of falling asleep).”
The FFS had good internal consistency (α=.86) within the sample and was not correlated with ESS scores (r = .20)

### Epworth Sleepiness Scale

Situational sleep propensity was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), an 8-item measure assessing the likelihood of dozing in specific situations (e.g. "sitting and reeading") [@johns1991]. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 ("would **never** doze") to 3 ("**high** chance of dozing").
Scores range from 0 to 24 with greater ESS scores indicating greater sleep propensity. 
The ESS had good internal consistency (α=.85) within the sample. 

### Karolinska Sleepiness Scale

Subjective sleepiness was assessed 5 minutes after natural wake time using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), a 9-point scale with verbal anchors at every second step ranging from 1 (“Extremely alert”) to 9, “Extremely sleepy - fighting sleep” [@akerstedt1990]. 
The scale measures an individual's percieved sleepiness at a given point, with the instructions "please measure your sleepiness over the past 5 minutes." *CHECK*

### Karolinska Drowsiness Test

The Karolinska Drowsiness Test (KDT) was administered immediately following the KSS and was used to measure electrophysiological drowsiness as measured through HD-EEG recordings.
Participants were instructed "Look at the dot in front of you and be as relaxed as possible while staying awake. Keep your head and body still and minimize blinking. After a few minutes, I’ll ask you to close your eyes and keep them closed for a few minutes. Finally, I’ll ask you to open your eyes again and keep them open for a few minutes." 
The test is 7 minutes long with 3 phases (eyes open/eyes closed/eyes open) each lasting 120 seconds. The eyes open conditions were concatenated during data analysis. 

### PSG sleep scoring and sleep macroarchitecture

Overnight polysomnography sleep data were recorded and were scored in 30 second epochs according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine Manual (AASM) criteria by an experienced rater [@berry2017]. 
PSG data included 256-channel EEG, electrocardiogram (ECG), nasal airflow pressure (nasal cannula), thoracic and abdominal respiratory effort, finger pulse oximetry (SpO2%), body position, and leg EMG measurements.
Sleep recordings were evaluated for the following parameters of sleep continuity: time in bed ( TIB, measured as total time spent in bed independent from sleep state); total sleep time (TST, defined as time between first sleep onset and final awakening, excluding periods awake); sleep onset latency (SOL, measured as time from lights out until first epoch of sleep); snooze time (measured from time of final awakening to time out of bed); REM latency (minutes from sleep onset to first epoch of REM sleep); wake after sleep onset (WASO, time spent awake between sleep onset and final awakening); sleep efficiency (ratio of TST to time in bed × 100 %); and total minutes/percentage in N1, N2, N3 and REM sleep (as scored using the AASM criteria). 

### HD-EEG

High-density EEG data were collected using 256-channel electrode caps (HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net 130 LTM, MagstimEGI, Eugene, OR, USA) with signals amplified (NetAmps 400, MagstimEGI, Eugene, OR, USA) and **which** digitised with electodes referenced to the vertex (CZ) [@cite]. 
During acquisition, data were low-pass filtered at **70** Hz, high-pass filtered at **0.3** Hz, and notch filtered at **50** Hz [@cite]. 
Electrode impedences were below **what** kΩ. 

### Slowing ratio

The EEG slowing ratio (SR) is a biomarker of sleepiness reflecting the general slowing of brain activity that appears with increasing sleepiness, with a dominance of slow frequency activity being indicative of decreased arousal [@drozario2013]. SR has been shown to be a valid measure of reduced alertness and increased drowsiness in clinical populations [@drozario2013; @sivam2020]
When the eyes are open, alpha, delta, and theta frequency activity is a marker of drowsiness, and the slowing ratio was calculated as [(δ + θ + α)/ (σ + β)] power.
As alpha activity reduced when the eyes are closed with increasing drowsiness, the slowing ratio was calculated as [(δ + θ)/ (α + σ + β)] power in the eyes closed condition. 
The slowing ratio was calculated for both absolute power and normalised power for each channel in both the eyes open and eyes closed conditions. 

### Alpha attenuation coefficient

The Alpha Attenuation Coefficient (AAC) measures alpha frequency power differences between eyes open and eyes closed conditions [@stampi1995]. The AAC is calculated by the ratio of alpha power in the eyes closed condition to alpha power in the eyes open condition. A lower AAC score reflects decreased cortical activity and increased sleepiness. 
The AAC was calculated for both absolute and normalised power for each channel. 
      
## Data processing

### EEG Processing

All preprocessing was completed using the EEG Processor application for MATLAB (@wassing2024). 
Data were visually inspected for artefacts and arousals which were removed across all channels. 
Poor quality channels were replaced with an interpolated EEG signal from neighbouring channels using linear mixing, weighted by the squared non-linear distance *on average how many per participant, +-SD)*. 

To enhance the local signal detection of each electrode and minimise the influence of the vertex (CZ) electrode, data were re-referenced to a common average signal created through finding the mean global signal across all electrodes.

### Independent Components Analysis

Following a visual inspection, independent components analysis (ICA) was used to identify and seperate components that are statistically independent from each other. 
This was done using a semi-automated process using the MATLAB program *ICLabel*, which automatically removed components with a weighting of .8 or greater for non-brain activity [@pion-tonachini2019]. Visual inspection was conducted to verify artefact removal and remove any components that did not reach the weighting threshold, but were visually deemed non-brain activity. 
Remaining components were back-projected to the EEG data signal via regression, resulting in a cleaned time series signal.

### Power Spectra

EEG power spectra was obtained for each channel using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to deconstruct the EEG signal from the time domain to the frequency domain, allowing it to be analysed in power (squared amplitude) in frequency bins (mV2/bin).
The power spectra was calculated for 50% overlapping 6-second epochs and obtained for the eyes closed condition and a concatenated recording of the eyes open condition. ```with a Hanning window, resulting in a frequency step of 0.122 Hz```
    **boundary clip?**
EEG spectral power densities were quantified as: low delta (0.5-1 Hz), delta (1–4.5 Hz), theta (4.5–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), sigma (12–15 Hz), beta (15–25 Hz), and gamma (25–40 Hz). 
Power spectral densities represent the distribution of power in a signal across frequencies, allowing analysis of the frequency components that are most significant in each epoch's signal. This allows the measurement of neuronal activity on vigilance states. 

To account for differences in absolute spectral power across participants, data was expressed as an absolute and normalised value for the defined frequency ranges for each participant [@drozario2023]. 

## Statistical analysis

All analyses were performed using MATLAB version r2024a (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). 

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was calculated for group differences in categorical variables in demographic variables, survey response meaures, sleep macro-architecture, and KSS scores to assess for significant differences (*p* < .05) between groups. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted using Tukey's HSD. 
The normality of the distribution and outliers was conducted using Q-Q Plots, Shapiro-Wilk normality tests, and visual inspections of histograms. 

Topographical high-density EEG analysis was conducted on 178 scalp channels after removal of neck, face, and forehead channels.

To account for non-normality, SR and AAC values were log transformed prior to analysis. 

For hypothesis 2, EEG power (absolute and normalised values for defined frequency ranges), SR, and AAC were compared for each condition (eyes open/eyes closed) between groups (ID, NRS, Control) using a one-way ANOVA (*p* < .05).
For hypothesis 3, KSS score was added as a covariate.

Electrodes showing regional differences in EEG activity were analyses using a permutation analysis to control for the potential of Type I errors. This involved using 10 000 random shuffles of the data to build a reference distribution of cluster sizes that occur due to chance, which can then be used to compare the found cluster size against (*p* < .05).
Blocks were permuted as whole-blocks and within-blocks.

# Introduction

## Background

Recent research suggests there may be a distinct subtype of insomnia called non-restorative sleep, characterized by sleep-state misperception.

## Sleep-state misperception

### Subsection of the middle bit

This is a subsection of the middle bit. Quisque sit amet tempus arcu, ac suscipit ante. Cras massa elit, pellentesque eget nisl ut, malesuada rutrum risus. Nunc in venenatis mi. Curabitur sit amet suscipit eros, non tincidunt nibh. Phasellus lorem lectus, iaculis non luctus eget, tempus non risus. Suspendisse ut felis mi. [@sweetman_prevalence_2021]

## Self-reported sleepiness

Self-reported sleepiness can be measured by the Karolinska sleepiness scale, which correlates to neural measures of drowsiness in healthy controls [@kaida_validation_2006]

# Method {#sec:method}

## Participants

12 participants from each clinical group (ID, NRS, HC) were recruited through referrals from the Woolcock Institute and the Royal Prince Alfred sleep clinics in addition to social media advertising. 
- Age and sex matched
- excluded if comorbid sleep disorder 
- Inclusion criteria for insomnia
- inclusion criteria for NRS
- Remunerated $100

## Measures

### KSS

- KSS is a 1 item 9-point likert scale measure
- internal and external validity
- measures sleepiness

### KDT

- KDT measured through HD-EEG data 
- Eyes open and eyes closed conditions
- Power spectra 


## Procedure

The study was approved by the Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee. 
- Participants come to the Woolcock 
- Sleep is monitored overnight 
- KSS and KDT recorded at 7am and 9am
- Other neurobehavioural testing also done

\newpage


# Results {#sec:results}

## Comparing KSS scores between groups

All analyses were conducted on Matlab version R2024a and EEGprocessor *version*. 


## Correlation between KSS and slowing ratio scores between groups

## Correlation between KSS and AAC between groups

## Topography of channel-by-channel comparisons between ID and NRS groups

\newpage


# Discussion {#sec:discussion}

The study aimed to explore the relationship between self-reported sleepiness scores, as measured by the KSS, and neural markers of drowsiness measured in the KDT across a sample of people with insomnia, non-restorative sleep, and healthy controls. 

### KSS score variance 

The study found that KSS scores varied across groups. 

### AAC

This is how AAC scores correlated amongst 3 groups

### Slowing Ratio

Here I will talk about slowing ratio

### Topographic electrode cluster differences between ID/NRS

Topographic power spectral analysis found these cluster differences which mean this

## Strengths

- Age and sex matching of participants
- Strong exclusion criteria

## Limitations

- Sample size

## Practical implications and future directions 

## Conclusion

The KSS is the best measure ever and more people should use it.

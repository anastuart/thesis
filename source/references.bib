  abstract = {Sleep reduction normally causes a homeostatic response during subsequent recovery sleep, but this does not seem to be true for repeated partial sleep loss. The aim of the present study was to test the response to repeated partial sleep loss through detailed focus on spectral data and parts of sleep.The experiment involved 4 h of sleep across 5 days in the laboratory (partial sleep deprivation [PSD]), followed by 3 days of recovery sleep. PSD was achieved through a delayed bedtime. Nine individuals participated. To avoid “laboratory monotony,” subjects were permitted to leave the lab for a few hours each day.All sleep stages and the latencies to sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS) showed a significant reduction during PSD. However, SWS and TST (total sleep time) during the first half of sleep increased gradually across days with PSD. During the first recovery sleep, SWS was significantly increased, while stage 1 and latency to stage 3 were reduced. All were back to baseline on the second night of recovery sleep.Summed spectral power during the first 3.8 h of sleep showed a gradual and robust increase (50\% above baseline) in the range 1.25–7.25 Hz across days with PSD up to first recovery sleep and then returned to baseline.SWS and summed power density in a broad low-frequency band respond to repeated partial sleep deprivation in a dose-response fashion during the first 4 h sleep, apparently reflecting a robust and stable homeostatic response to sleep loss.},

  abstract = {The main consequence of insufficient sleep is sleepiness. While measures of sleep latency, continuous encephalographical/electro-oculographical (EEG/EOG) recording and performance tests are useful indicators of sleepiness in the laboratory and clinic, they are not easily implemented in large, real-life field studies. Subjective ratings of sleepiness, which are easily applied and unobtrusive, are an alternative, but whether they measure sleepiness sensitively, reliably and validly remains uncertain. This review brings together research relevant to these issues. It is focused on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), which is a nine-point Likert-type scale. The diurnal pattern of sleepiness is U-shaped, with high KSS values in the morning and late evening, and with great stability across years. KSS values increase sensitively during acute total and repeated partial sleep deprivation and night work, including night driving. The effect sizes range between 1.5 and 3. The relation to driving performance or EEG/EOG indicators of sleepiness is highly significant, strongly curvilinear and consistent across individuals. High ({$>$}6) KSS values are associated particularly with impaired driving performance and sleep intrusions in the EEG. KSS values are also increased in many clinical conditions such as sleep apnea, depression and burnout. The context has a strong influence on KSS ratings. Thus, physical activity, social interaction and light exposure will reduce KSS values by 1–2 units. In contrast, time-on-task in a monotonous context will increase KSS values by 1–2 units. In summary, subjective ratings of sleepiness as described here is as sensitive and valid an indicator of sleepiness as objective measures, and particularly suitable for field studies.},

  abstract = {Although the EEG slow wave of sleep is typically considered to be a hallmark of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, recent work in mice has shown that slow waves can also occur in REM sleep. Here, we investigated the presence and cortical distribution of negative delta (1–4 Hz) waves in human REM sleep by analyzing high-density EEG sleep recordings obtained in 28 healthy subjects. We identified two clusters of delta waves with distinctive properties: (1) a frontal-central cluster characterized by ∼2.5–3.0 Hz, relatively large, notched delta waves (so-called “sawtooth waves”) that tended to occur in bursts, were associated with increased gamma activity and rapid eye movements (EMs), and upon source modeling displayed an occipital-temporal and a frontal-central component and (2) a medial-occipital cluster characterized by more isolated, slower ({$<$}2 Hz), and smaller waves that were not associated with rapid EMs, displayed a negative correlation with gamma activity, and were also found in NREM sleep. Therefore, delta waves are an integral part of REM sleep in humans and the two identified subtypes (sawtooth and medial-occipital slow waves) may reflect distinct generation mechanisms and functional roles. Sawtooth waves, which are exclusive to REM sleep, share many characteristics with ponto-geniculo-occipital waves described in animals and may represent the human equivalent or a closely related event, whereas medial-occipital slow waves appear similar to NREM sleep slow waves. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The EEG slow wave is typically considered a hallmark of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, but recent work in mice has shown that it can also occur in REM sleep. By analyzing high-density EEG recordings collected in healthy adult individuals, we show that REM sleep is characterized by prominent delta waves also in humans. In particular, we identified two distinctive clusters of delta waves with different properties: a frontal-central cluster characterized by faster, activating “sawtooth waves” that share many characteristics with ponto-geniculo-occipital waves described in animals and a medial-occipital cluster containing slow waves that are more similar to NREM sleep slow waves. These findings indicate that REM sleep is a spatially and temporally heterogeneous state and may contribute to explaining its known functional and phenomenological properties.},

  abstract = {Although daytime complaints are a defining characteristic of insomnia, most EEG studies evaluated sleep only. We used high-density electroencephalography to investigate wake resting state oscillations characteristic of insomnia disorder (ID) at a fine-grained spatiospectral resolution.A case-control assessment during eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) was performed in a laboratory for human physiology. Participants (n = 94, 74 female, 21–70 y) were recruited through www.sleepregistry.nl: 51 with ID, according to DSM-5 and 43 matched controls. Exclusion criteria were any somatic, neurological or psychiatric condition. Group differences in the spectral power topographies across multiple frequencies (1.5 to 40 Hz) were evaluated using permutation-based inference with Threshold-Free Cluster-Enhancement, to correct for multiple comparisons.As compared to controls, participants with ID showed less power in a narrow upper alpha band (11–12.7 Hz, peak: 11.7 Hz) over bilateral frontal and left temporal regions during EO, and more power in a broad beta frequency range (16.3–40 Hz, peak: 19 Hz) globally during EC. Source estimates suggested global rather than cortically localized group differences.The widespread high power in a broad beta band reported previously during sleep in insomnia is present as well during eyes closed wakefulness, suggestive of a round-the-clock hyperarousal. Low power in the upper alpha band during eyes open is consistent with low cortical inhibition and attentional filtering. The fine-grained HD-EEG findings suggest that, while more feasible than PSG, wake EEG of short duration with a few well-chosen electrodes and frequency bands, can provide valuable features of insomnia.Whereas round-the-clock hyperarousal is considered characteristic of insomnia, its representation in wake EEG is insufficiently known. We compared the spatiospectral properties of high-density wake EEG of 51 people with insomnia and 43 matched controls without sleep complaints. Just as previously reported during sleep, people with insomnia show widespread increased beta power during eyes closed wakefulness. During eyes open, their EEG moreover shows relatively little power in a narrow band in the upper-alpha range. The low correlation between these two features suggests they may reflect distinct processes, respectively high arousal and low inhibition. Future studies may employ these measures to evaluate subtypes of insomnia and relevance for variability in profiles of complaints about sleep and daytime functioning.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a surge in human sleep electroencephalography (EEG) studies, employing increasingly sophisticated analysis strategies to relate electrophysiological activity to cognition and disease. However, properly calculating and interpreting metrics used in contemporary sleep EEG requires attention to numerous theoretical and practical signal-processing details that are not always obvious. Moreover, the vast number of outcome measures that can be derived from a single dataset inflates the risk of false positives and threatens replicability. We review several methodological issues related to 1) spectral analysis, 2) montage choice, 3) extraction of phase and amplitude information, 4) surrogate construction, and 5) minimizing false positives, illustrating both the impact of methodological choices on downstream results, and the importance of checking processing steps through visualization and simplified examples. By presenting these issues in non-mathematical form, with sleep-specific examples, and with code implementation, this paper aims to instill a deeper appreciation of methodological considerations in novice and non-technical audiences, and thereby help improve the quality of future sleep EEG studies.},

  abstract = {Since their discovery, slow oscillations have been observed to group spindles during non-REM sleep. Previous studies assert that the slow-oscillation downstate (DS) is preceded by slow spindles (10–12 Hz) and followed by fast spindles (12–16 Hz). Here, using both direct transcortical recordings in patients with intractable epilepsy (n = 10, 8 female), as well as scalp EEG recordings from a healthy cohort (n = 3, 1 female), we find in multiple cortical areas that both slow and fast spindles follow the DS. Although discrete oscillations do precede DSs, they are theta bursts (TBs) centered at 5–8 Hz. TBs were more pronounced for DSs in NREM stage 2 (N2) sleep compared with N3. TB with similar properties occur in the thalamus, but unlike spindles they have no clear temporal relationship with cortical TB. These differences in corticothalamic dynamics, as well as differences between spindles and theta in coupling high-frequency content, are consistent with NREM theta having separate generative mechanisms from spindles. The final inhibitory cycle of the TB coincides with the DS peak, suggesting that in N2, TB may help trigger the DS. Since the transition to N1 is marked by the appearance of theta, and the transition to N2 by the appearance of DS and thus spindles, a role of TB in triggering DS could help explain the sequence of electrophysiological events characterizing sleep. Finally, the coordinated appearance of spindles and DSs are implicated in memory consolidation processes, and the current findings redefine their temporal coupling with theta during NREM sleep. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Sleep is characterized by large slow waves which modulate brain activity. Prominent among these are downstates (DSs), periods of a few tenths of a second when most cells stop firing, and spindles, oscillations at ∼12 times a second lasting for ∼a second. In this study, we provide the first detailed description of another kind of sleep wave: theta bursts (TBs), a brief oscillation at ∼six cycles per second. We show, recording during natural sleep directly from the human cortex and thalamus, as well as on the scalp, that TBs precede, and spindles follow DSs. TBs may help trigger DSs in some circumstances, and could organize cortical and thalamic activity so that memories can be consolidated during sleep.},

Furthermore, we tried to explore how these symptoms relate to alertness, depressive symptoms and illness intrusiveness. In a prospective observational study, 283 sleep-disordered patients referred to a hospital-based sleep laboratory for various indications over a 1-year period were evaluated vis-à-vis fatigue and sleepiness. All patients completed five subjective questionnaires, underwent objective sleep recording and attended a clinical interview with a sleep specialist. The subjective questionnaires included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Toronto Hospital Alertness Test, the Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. Only 4\% of the total sample was referred to the sleep clinic due to a complaint of excessive fatigue compared with 17\% for excessive daytime sleepiness. However, during the assessment, 64\% of referred patients reported pathological fatigue without overlap of sleepiness and only 4\% reported pathological sleepiness without overlap of fatigue. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated a weak association (r = 0.18) between subjective fatigue and sleepiness in the total sample. Analysis of variance testing showed strong association between those patients with prominent fatigue and depressive symptoms (P {$<$} 0.01) and illness intrusiveness (P {$<$} 0.001). The findings support the notion that subjective fatigue and sleepiness can be independent manifestations of sleep disorders. Furthermore, predominantly fatigued individuals with sleep disorders seem vulnerable to additional negative consequences due to possible interplay between amplified fatigue and psychological distress.},

Studies have investigated various physiological associations with fatigue to try to identify fatigue indicators. The current study assessed the four electroencephalography (EEG) activities, delta (δ), theta (θ), alpha (α) and beta (β), during a monotonous driving session in 52 subjects (36 males and 16 females). Performance of four algorithms, which were: algorithm (i) (θ+α)/β, algorithm (ii) α/β, algorithm (iii) (θ+α)/(α+β), and algorithm (iv) θ/β, were also assessed as possible indicators for fatigue detection. Results showed stable delta and theta activities over time, a slight decrease of alpha activity, and a significant decrease of beta activity (p{$<$}0.05). All four algorithms showed an increase in the ratio of slow wave to fast wave EEG activities over time. Algorithm (i) (θ+α)/β showed a larger increase. The results have implications for detecting fatigue. Impact on industry: The results of this research have the implication for detecting fatigue and can be used for future development of fatigue countermeasure devices.},

METHODS: Participants were 16 healthy females aged 33-43 (38.1+/-2.68) years. The experiment involved 8 measurement sessions per day for 3 consecutive days. Each session contained the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), the Karolinska drowsiness test (KDT-EEG alpha \& theta power), the alpha attenuation test (AAT-alpha power ratio open/closed eyes) and the KSS. RESULTS: Median reaction time, number of lapses, alpha and theta power density and the alpha attenuation coefficients (AAC) showed highly significant increase with increasing KSS. The same variables were also significantly correlated with KSS, with a mean value for lapses (r=0.56). CONCLUSIONS: The KSS was closely related to EEG and behavioral variables, indicating a high validity in measuring sleepiness. SIGNIFICANCE: KSS ratings may be a useful proxy for EEG or behavioral indicators of sleepiness.},

  abstract = {Insomnia disorder (ID) is a heterogeneous disorder with proposed subtypes based on objective sleep duration. We speculated that insomnia subtyping with additional power spectral analysis and measurement of response to acute sleep restriction may be informative in overall assessment of ID. To explore alternative classifications of ID subtypes, insomnia patients (n\,=\,99) underwent two consecutive overnight sleep studies: (i) habitual sleep opportunity (polysomnography, PSG) and, (ii) two hours less sleep opportunity (electroencephalography, EEG), with the first night compared to healthy controls (n\,=\,25). ID subtypes were derived from data-driven classification of PSG, EEG spectral power and interhemispheric EEG asymmetry index. Three insomnia subtypes with different sleep duration and NREM spectral power were identified. One subtype (n\,=\,26) had shorter sleep duration and lower NREM delta power than healthy controls (short-sleep delta-deficient; SSDD), the second subtype (n\,=\,51) had normal sleep duration but lower NREM delta power than healthy controls (normal-sleep delta-deficient; NSDD) and a third subtype showed (n\,=\,22) no difference in sleep duration or delta power from healthy controls (normal neurophysiological sleep; NNS). Acute sleep restriction improved multiple objective sleep measures across all insomnia subtypes including increased delta power in SSDD and NSDD, and improvements in subjective sleep quality for SSDD (p\,=\,0.03), with a trend observed for NSDD (p\,=\,0.057). These exploratory results suggest evidence of novel neurophysiological insomnia subtypes that may inform sleep state misperception in ID and with further research, may provide pathways for personalised care.},

Methods Fifty-one insomnia patients and 53 HC underwent 6 nights of polysomnography. Four methods for estimating Delta Decline were compared (exponential and linear best-fit functions using NREM (1) episode mean, (2) peak, and (3) total delta power and (4) delta power for all available NREM epochs). The best method was applied to compare groups on linear and exponential rates of Delta Decline. Results Best-fit models using all available NREM epochs were significantly less vulnerable to deviation due to missing data than other methods. Insomnia patients displayed significantly slower linear and exponential Delta Decline than HC. Conclusions Computing Delta Decline using all available NREM epochs was the best of the methods studied for minimizing the effects of missing data. Insomnia patients display slower Delta Decline, which is not explained by differences in total sleep time or wake after sleep onset. Significance This study supports using all available NREM epochs in Delta Decline computation and suggests a slower rate in insomnia.},

  abstract = {During much of sleep, virtually all cortical neurons undergo a slow oscillation ({$<$}1 Hz) in membrane potential, cycling from a hyperpolarized state of silence to a depolarized state of intense firing. This slow oscillation is the fundamental cellular phenomenon that organizes other sleep rhythms such as spindles and slow waves. Using high-density electroencephalogram recordings in humans, we show here that each cycle of the slow oscillation is a traveling wave. Each wave originates at a definite site and travels over the scalp at an estimated speed of 1.2-7.0 m/sec. Waves originate more frequently in prefrontal-orbitofrontal regions and propagate in an anteroposterior direction. Their rate of occurrence increases progressively reaching almost once per second as sleep deepens. The pattern of origin and propagation of sleep slow oscillations is reproducible across nights and subjects and provides a blueprint of cortical excitability and connectivity. The orderly propagation of correlated activity along connected pathways may play a role in spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity during sleep.},

Sleep-stage analysis revealed that morning types and evening types did not differ in sleep architecture. However, morning-type men showed a higher percentage of stage 1 sleep and lower sleep efficiency than evening-type men. Electroencephalogram spectral analysis was conducted in non-rapid eye movement sleep for 6 frequency bands. Morning types had more spectral power in low sigma (12-14 Hz) compared with evening types. The most robust difference between women and men was found in high sigma (14-16 Hz) and was not present between chronotypes. The decay rate of slow-wave activity (1-5 Hz) tended to be faster in morning types compared with evening types (P = .06). This rate was almost identical for women and men.These results agree with the hypothesis that homeostatic sleep regulation differs between morning types and evening types, with morning types showing indications of a higher rate of dissipation of sleep pressure during the night. Morningness-eveningness seems to affect sleep in a sex-specific manner, with men being more affected by their chronotype.},

  abstract = {We describe a novel slow oscillation in intracellular recordings from cortical association areas 5 and 7, motor areas 4 and 6, and visual areas 17 and 18 of cats under various anesthetics. The recorded neurons (n = 254) were antidromically and orthodromically identified as corticothalamic or callosal elements receiving projections from appropriate thalamic nuclei as well as from homotopic foci in the contralateral cortex. Two major types of cells were recorded: regular- spiking (mainly slow-adapting, but also fast-adapting) neurons and intrinsically bursting cells. A group of slowly oscillating neurons (n = 21) were intracellularly stained and found to be pyramidal-shaped cells in layers III-VI, with luxuriant basal dendritic arbors. The slow rhythm appeared in 88\% of recorded neurons. It consisted of slow depolarizing envelopes (lasting for 0.8–1.5 sec) with superimposed full action potentials or presumed dendritic spikes, followed by long- lasting hyperpolarizations. Such sequences recurred rhythmically at less than 1 Hz, with a prevailing oscillation between 0.3 and 0.4 Hz in 67\% of urethane-anesthetized animals. While in most neurons (approximately 70\%) the repetitive spikes superimposed on the slow depolarization were completely blocked by slight DC hyperpolarization, 30\% of cells were found to display relatively small (3–12 mV), rapid, all-or-none potentials after obliteration of full action potentials. These fast spikes were suppressed in an all-or-none fashion at Vm more negative than -90 mV. The depolarizing envelope of the slow rhythm was reduced or suppressed at a Vm of -90 to -100 mV and its duration was greatly reduced by administration of the NMDA blocker ketamine. In keeping with this action, most (56\%) neurons recorded in animals under ketamine and nitrous oxide or ketamine and xylazine anesthesia displayed the slow oscillation at higher frequencies (0.6–1 Hz) than under urethane anesthesia (0.3–0.4 Hz). In 18\% of the oscillating cells, the slow rhythm mainly consisted of repetitive (15–30 Hz), relatively short-lasting (15–25 msec) IPSPs that could be revealed by bringing the Vm at more positive values than -70 mV. The long-lasting (approximately 1 sec) hyperpolarizing phase of the slow oscillation was best observed at the resting Vm and was reduced at about -100 mV. Simultaneous recording of another cell across the membrane demonstrated synchronous inhibitory periods in both neurons. Intracellular diffusion of Cl- or Cs+ reduced the amplitude and/or duration of cyclic long- lasting hyperpolaryzations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {In this first intracellular study of neocortical activities during waking and sleep states, we hypothesized that synaptic activities during natural states of vigilance have a decisive impact on the observed electrophysiological properties of neurons that were previously studied under anesthesia or in brain slices. We investigated the incidence of different firing patterns in neocortical neurons of awake cats, the relation between membrane potential fluctuations and firing rates, and the input resistance during all states of vigilance. In awake animals, the neurons displaying fast-spiking firing patterns were more numerous, whereas the incidence of neurons with intrinsically bursting patterns was much lower than in our previous experiments conducted on the intact-cortex or isolated cortical slabs of anesthetized cats. Although cortical neurons displayed prolonged hyperpolarizing phases during slow-wave sleep, the firing rates during the depolarizing phases of the slow sleep oscillation was as high during these epochs as during waking and rapid-eye-movement sleep. Maximum firing rates, exceeding those of regular-spiking neurons, were reached by conventional fast-spiking neurons during both waking and sleep states, and by fast-rhythmic-bursting neurons during waking. The input resistance was more stable and it increased during quiet wakefulness, compared with sleep states. As waking is associated with high synaptic activity, we explain this result by a higher release of activating neuromodulators, which produce an increase in the input resistance of cortical neurons. In view of the high firing rates in the functionally disconnected state of slow-wave sleep, we suggest that neocortical neurons are engaged in processing internally generated signals.},

Despite lacking a standard, operational definition, NRS is investigated in research studies and included in diagnostic manuals. However, because of the absence of standardization, the conclusions that can be drawn about NRS based on the current body of empirical literature are limited. A feeling of being unrefreshed upon awakening that is not accounted for by lack of sleep may occur among a substantial percentage of the population. This experience is correlated with daytime impairment, pain, fatigue, and electroencephalogram (EEG) arousals in non-REM sleep but causal links are unsubstantiated. An immediate converging of researchers toward NRS standardization is needed. We conclude that conceptualizing NRS as a primary symptom of insomnia on par with difficulty initiating sleep and difficulty maintaining sleep is empirically unsubstantiated. We recommend defining NRS as a report of persistently feeling unrefreshed upon awakening in the presence of a normal sleep duration, occurring in the absence of a sleep disorder.},

  abstract = {Introduction Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are the two most prevalent sleep disorders, and frequently co-occur (COMISA) in sleep clinic samples. However, few studies have investigated the prevalence or associations of COMISA in the general population. Methods We used population-based online survey data from 2044 Australian adults. The prevalence and associations of insomnia, OSA and COMISA were investigated according to symptom-level, and disorder-level definitions. Insomnia was defined according to chronic difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep (DIMS; symptom-level), and ICSD-3 chronic insomnia disorder (disorder-level). OSA was defined according to self-reported frequent obstructive events, snoring or doctor-diagnosed OSA (symptom-level), and doctor-diagnosed OSA (disorder-level). COMISA was defined if both conditions were met (for symptom-level, and disorder-level threshold). Associations with other conditions, and general health were investigated with Poisson regression analyses. Results Chronic insomnia occurred more frequently among participants with doctor-diagnosed OSA (22.3\%), compared to those without (14.3\%, p~=~0.010). Doctor-diagnosed OSA was more common among participants with chronic insomnia (10.2\%) compared to those without (6.2\%; p~=~0.010). DIMS also occurred more frequently among participants with OSA symptoms (66.6\%), compared to those without (47.2\%; p~{$<~$}0.001). Participants with symptom-level COMISA reported increased co-morbid conditions, and worse general health compared to participants with symptoms of insomnia-alone, OSA-alone, or neither insomnia/OSA. Conclusions COMISA at symptom and disorder level were common and associated with increased medical and psychiatric co-morbidity, as well as poor general health. More investigation is required to understand bi-directional associations underpinning the high co-morbidity, and improve diagnostic and treatment approaches for COMISA to reduce associated morbidity.},

  abstract = {Until recently, the association of chronic insomnia with significant medical morbidity was not established and its diagnosis was based solely on subjective complaints. We present evidence that insomnia with objective short sleep duration is the most biologically severe phenotype of the disorder, as it is associated with cognitive-emotional and cortical arousal, activation of both limbs of the stress system, and a higher risk for hypertension, impaired heart rate variability, diabetes, neurocognitive impairment, and mortality. Also, it appears that objective short sleep duration is a biological marker of genetic predisposition to chronic insomnia. In contrast, insomnia with objective normal sleep duration is associated with cognitive-emotional and cortical arousal and sleep misperception but not with signs of activation of both limbs of the stress system or medical complications. Furthermore, the first phenotype is associated with unremitting course, whereas the latter is more likely to remit. We propose that short sleep duration in insomnia is a reliable marker of the biological severity and medical impact of the disorder. Objective measures of sleep obtained in the home environment of the patient would become part of the routine assessment of insomnia patients in a clinician's office setting. We speculate that insomnia with objective short sleep duration has primarily biological roots and may respond better to biological treatments, whereas insomnia with objective normal sleep duration has primarily psychological roots and may respond better to psychological interventions alone.},

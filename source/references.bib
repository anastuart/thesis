  abstract = {The main consequence of insufficient sleep is sleepiness. While measures of sleep latency, continuous encephalographical/electro-oculographical (EEG/EOG) recording and performance tests are useful indicators of sleepiness in the laboratory and clinic, they are not easily implemented in large, real-life field studies. Subjective ratings of sleepiness, which are easily applied and unobtrusive, are an alternative, but whether they measure sleepiness sensitively, reliably and validly remains uncertain. This review brings together research relevant to these issues. It is focused on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), which is a nine-point Likert-type scale. The diurnal pattern of sleepiness is U-shaped, with high KSS values in the morning and late evening, and with great stability across years. KSS values increase sensitively during acute total and repeated partial sleep deprivation and night work, including night driving. The effect sizes range between 1.5 and 3. The relation to driving performance or EEG/EOG indicators of sleepiness is highly significant, strongly curvilinear and consistent across individuals. High ({$>$}6) KSS values are associated particularly with impaired driving performance and sleep intrusions in the EEG. KSS values are also increased in many clinical conditions such as sleep apnea, depression and burnout. The context has a strong influence on KSS ratings. Thus, physical activity, social interaction and light exposure will reduce KSS values by 1–2 units. In contrast, time-on-task in a monotonous context will increase KSS values by 1–2 units. In summary, subjective ratings of sleepiness as described here is as sensitive and valid an indicator of sleepiness as objective measures, and particularly suitable for field studies.},

  abstract = {The observations of the loss of cholinergic function in neocortex and hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease (AD) developed the hypothesis that replacement of cholinergic function may be of therapeutic benefit to AD patients. The different approaches proposed or tested included intervention with acetylcholine (ACh) precursors, stimulation of ACh release, use of muscarinic or nicotinic receptor agonists and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition. Inhibition of endogenous ACh degradation through ChE inhibitors and precursor loading were treatments more largely investigated in clinical trials. Of the numerous compounds in development for the treatment of AD, AChE and ChE inhibitors are the most clinically advanced, although clinical trials conducted to date did not always confirm a significant benefit of these drugs on all symptom domains of AD. The first attempts in the treatment of AD with cholinergic precursors did not confirm a clinical utility of this class of compounds in well controlled clinical trials. However, cholinergic precursors most largely used such as choline and phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) were probably not suitable for enhancing brain levels of ACh. Other phospholipids involved in choline biosynthetic pathways such as CDP-choline, choline alphoscerate and phosphatidylserine clearly enhanced ACh availability or release and provided a modest improvement of cognitive dysfunction in AD, these effects being more pronounced with choline alphoscerate. Although some positive results cannot be generalized due to the small numbers of patients studied, they probably would justify reconsideration of the most promising molecules in larger carefully controlled trials.},

Significant cholinergic dysfunctions occur in the aged and demented central nervous system, relationships between these changes and loss of memory exist, similar memory deficits can be artificially induced by blocking cholinergic mechanisms in young subjects, and under certain tightly controlled conditions reliable memory improvements in aged subjects can be achieved after cholinergic stimulation. Conventional attempts to reduce memory impairments in clinical trials have not been therapeutically successful, however.

  abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a disorder that causes degeneration of the cells in the brain and it is the main cause of dementia, which is characterized by a decline in thinking and independence in personal daily activities. AD is considered a multifactorial disease: two main hypotheses were proposed as a cause for AD, cholinergic and amyloid hypotheses. Additionally, several risk factors such as increasing age, genetic factors, head injuries, vascular diseases, infections, and environmental factors play a role in the disease. Currently, there are only two classes of approved drugs to treat AD, including inhibitors to cholinesterase enzyme and antagonists to N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA), which are effective only in treating the symptoms of AD, but do not cure or prevent the disease. Nowadays, the research is focusing on understanding AD pathology by targeting several mechanisms, such as abnormal tau protein metabolism, β-amyloid, inflammatory response, and cholinergic and free radical damage, aiming to develop successful treatments that are capable of stopping or modifying the course of AD. This review discusses currently available drugs and future theories for the development of new therapies for AD, such as disease-modifying therapeutics (DMT), chaperones, and natural compounds.},

  abstract = {Mounting evidence implicates disturbed sleep or lack of sleep as one of the risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the extent of the risk is uncertain. We conducted a broad systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the effect of sleep problems/disorders on cognitive impairment and AD.Original published literature assessing any association of sleep problems or disorders with cognitive impairment or AD was identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library. Effect estimates of individual studies were pooled and relative risks (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random effects models. We also estimated the population attributable risk.Twenty-seven observational studies (n = 69216 participants) that provided 52 RR estimates were included in the meta-analysis. Individuals with sleep problems had a 1.55 (95\% CI: 1.25–1.93), 1.65 (95\% CI: 1.45–1.86), and 3.78 (95\% CI: 2.27–6.30) times higher risk of AD, cognitive impairment, and preclinical AD than individuals without sleep problems, respectively. The overall meta-analysis revealed that individuals with sleep problems had a 1.68 (95\% CI: 1.51–1.87) times higher risk for the combined outcome of cognitive impairment and/or AD. Approximately 15\% of AD in the population may be attributed to sleep problems.This meta-analysis confirmed the association between sleep and cognitive impairment or AD and, for the first time, consolidated the evidence to provide an “average” magnitude of effect. As sleep problems are of a growing concern in the population, these findings are of interest for potential prevention of AD.},

  abstract = {Neocortical Aβ-amyloid deposition, one of the hallmark pathologic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), begins decades prior to the presence of clinical symptoms. As clinical trials move to secondary and even primary prevention, understanding the rates of neocortical Aβ-amyloid deposition and the age at which Aβ-amyloid deposition becomes abnormal is crucial for optimizing the timing of these trials. As APOE-ε4 carriage is thought to modulate the age of clinical onset, it is also important to understand the impact of APOE-ε4 carriage on the age at which the neocortical Aβ-amyloid deposition becomes abnormal. Here, we show that, for 455 participants with over 3 years of follow-up, abnormal levels of neocortical Aβ-amyloid were reached on average at age 72 (66.5–77.1). The APOE-ε4 carriers reached abnormal levels earlier at age 63 (59.6–70.3); however, noncarriers reached the threshold later at age 78 (76.1–84.4). No differences in the rates of deposition were observed between APOE-ε4 carriers and noncarriers after abnormal Aβ-amyloid levels had been reached. These results suggest that primary and secondary prevention trials, looking to recruit at the earliest stages of disease, should target APOE-ε4 carriers between the ages of 60 and 66 and noncarriers between the ages of 76 and~84.},

Basal forebrain cholinergic system (BFCS) atrophy is reported to precede both entorhinal cortex atrophy and memory impairment in AD, challenging the traditional model of the temporal sequence of topographical pathology associated with AD. We studied the effect of one-year Donepezil treatment on the rate of BFCS atrophy in prodromal AD patients using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of Donepezil (10\,mg/day). Reduced annual BFCS rates of atrophy were found in the Donepezil group compared to the Placebo treated arm. Secondary analyses on BFCS subregions demonstrated the largest treatment effects in the Nucleus Basalis of Meynert (NbM) and the medial septum/diagonal band (Ch1/2). Donepezil administered at a prodromal stage of AD seems to substantially reduce the rate of atrophy of the BFCS nuclei with highest concentration of cholinergic neurons projecting to the cortex (NbM), hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (Ch1/2).},

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive and commonly diagnosed neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by memory and cognitive decline and behavioral disorders. The pathogenesis of AD is complex and remains unclear, being affected by various factors. The cholinergic hypothesis is the earliest theory about the pathogenesis of AD. Cholinergic atrophy and cognitive decline are accelerated in age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. In addition, abnormal central cholinergic changes can also induce abnormal phosphorylation of ttau protein, nerve cell inflammation, cell apoptosis, and other pathological phenomena, but the exact mechanism of action is still unclear. Due to the complex and unclear pathogenesis, effective methods to prevent and treat AD are unavailable, and research to explore novel therapeutic drugs is various and active in the world.

  abstract = {Although daytime complaints are a defining characteristic of insomnia, most EEG studies evaluated sleep only. We used high-density electroencephalography to investigate wake resting state oscillations characteristic of insomnia disorder (ID) at a fine-grained spatiospectral resolution.A case-control assessment during eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) was performed in a laboratory for human physiology. Participants (n = 94, 74 female, 21–70 y) were recruited through www.sleepregistry.nl: 51 with ID, according to DSM-5 and 43 matched controls. Exclusion criteria were any somatic, neurological or psychiatric condition. Group differences in the spectral power topographies across multiple frequencies (1.5 to 40 Hz) were evaluated using permutation-based inference with Threshold-Free Cluster-Enhancement, to correct for multiple comparisons.As compared to controls, participants with ID showed less power in a narrow upper alpha band (11–12.7 Hz, peak: 11.7 Hz) over bilateral frontal and left temporal regions during EO, and more power in a broad beta frequency range (16.3–40 Hz, peak: 19 Hz) globally during EC. Source estimates suggested global rather than cortically localized group differences.The widespread high power in a broad beta band reported previously during sleep in insomnia is present as well during eyes closed wakefulness, suggestive of a round-the-clock hyperarousal. Low power in the upper alpha band during eyes open is consistent with low cortical inhibition and attentional filtering. The fine-grained HD-EEG findings suggest that, while more feasible than PSG, wake EEG of short duration with a few well-chosen electrodes and frequency bands, can provide valuable features of insomnia.Whereas round-the-clock hyperarousal is considered characteristic of insomnia, its representation in wake EEG is insufficiently known. We compared the spatiospectral properties of high-density wake EEG of 51 people with insomnia and 43 matched controls without sleep complaints. Just as previously reported during sleep, people with insomnia show widespread increased beta power during eyes closed wakefulness. During eyes open, their EEG moreover shows relatively little power in a narrow band in the upper-alpha range. The low correlation between these two features suggests they may reflect distinct processes, respectively high arousal and low inhibition. Future studies may employ these measures to evaluate subtypes of insomnia and relevance for variability in profiles of complaints about sleep and daytime functioning.},

Whether these profound deficits in cholinergic markers found in end-stage patients are also found in patients with much earlier disease is not known.ObjectiveTo determine whether cholinergic deficits in AD precede, follow, or occur in synchrony with the earliest signs of cognitive deterioration.Design, Setting, and PatientsPostmortem study of nursing home residents with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale scores of 0.0 to 2.0 and 4.0 to 5.0 who underwent autopsy between 1986 and 1997, comparing the activity of the cholinergic marker enzymes in the cortices of 66 elderly subjects with no (CDR score=0.0; n=18), questionable (CDR score=0.5; n=11), mild (CDR score=1.0; n=22), or moderate (CDR score=2.0; n=15) dementia vs subjects with severe dementia (CDR score=4.0-5.0; n=15).Main Outcome MeasuresActivity of the cholinergic marker enzymes choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase in 9 neocortical brain regions.ResultsThe activity of choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase in 9 neocortical brain regions did not differ significantly in subjects with CDR scores of 0.0 to 2.0, but was significantly lower in subjects with severe dementia (CDR score=4.0-5.0). Choline acetyltransferase levels were significantly correlated with severity of neuropathological lesions of AD, as measured by density of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.ConclusionsAlthough neocortical cholinergic deficits are characteristic of severely demented AD patients, in this study, cholinergic deficits were not apparent in individuals with mild AD and were not present until relatively late in the course of the disease. These results suggest that patients with more severe disease should be a target for cholinergic treatment.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by presence of extracellular fibrillar Aβ in amyloid plaques, intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles consisting of aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau and elevated brain levels of soluble Aβ oligomers (ADDLs). A major question is how these disparate facets of AD pathology are mechanistically related. Here we show that, independent of the presence of fibrils, ADDLs stimulate tau phosphorylation in mature cultures of hippocampal neurons and in neuroblastoma cells at epitopes characteristically hyperphosphorylated in AD. A monoclonal antibody that targets ADDLs blocked their attachment to synaptic binding sites and prevented tau hyperphosphorylation. Tau phosphorylation was blocked by the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7(t-butyl)pyrazol(3,4-d)pyramide (PP1), and by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Significantly, tau hyperphosphorylation was also induced by a soluble aqueous extract containing Aβ oligomers from AD brains, but not by an extract from non-AD brains. Aβ oligomers have been increasingly implicated as the main neurotoxins in AD, and the current results provide a unifying mechanism in which oligomer activity is directly linked to tau hyperphosphorylation in AD pathology.},

Data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center and five large cohorts with AD biomarkers were analyzed. The analysis included 3,297 individuals for the pathological study and 10,039 for the clinical study. Findings revealed that almost all APOE4 homozygotes exhibited AD pathology and had significantly higher levels of AD biomarkers from age 55 compared to APOE3 homozygotes. By age 65, nearly all had abnormal amyloid levels in cerebrospinal fluid, and 75\% had positive amyloid scans, with the prevalence of these markers increasing with age, indicating near-full penetrance of AD biology in APOE4 homozygotes. The age of symptom onset was earlier in APOE4 homozygotes at 65.1, with a narrower 95\% prediction interval than APOE3 homozygotes. The predictability of symptom onset and the sequence of biomarker changes in APOE4 homozygotes mirrored those in autosomal dominant AD and Down syndrome. However, in the dementia stage, there were no differences in amyloid or tau positron emission tomography across haplotypes, despite earlier clinical and biomarker changes. The study concludes that APOE4 homozygotes represent a genetic form of AD, suggesting the need for individualized prevention strategies, clinical trials and treatments.},

  abstract = {The current conceptualization of Alzheimer disease (AD) is driven by the amyloid hypothesis, in which a deterministic chain of events leads from amyloid deposition and then tau deposition to neurodegeneration and progressive cognitive impairment. This model fits autosomal dominant AD but is less applicable to sporadic AD. Owing to emerging information regarding the complex biology of AD and the challenges of developing amyloid-targeting drugs, the amyloid hypothesis needs to be reconsidered. Here we propose a probabilistic model of AD in which three variants of AD (autosomal dominant AD, APOE ε4-related sporadic AD and APOE ε4-unrelated sporadic AD) feature decreasing penetrance and decreasing weight of the amyloid pathophysiological cascade, and increasing weight of stochastic factors (environmental exposures and lower-risk genes). Together, these variants account for a large share of the neuropathological and clinical variability observed in people with AD. The implementation of this model in research might lead to a better understanding of disease pathophysiology, a~revision of the current clinical taxonomy and accelerated development of strategies to prevent and treat AD.},

  abstract = {Cholinergic synapses are ubiquitous in the human central nervous system. Their high density in the thalamus, striatum, limbic system, and neocortex suggest that cholinergic transmission is likely to be critically important for memory, learning, attention and other higher brain functions. Several lines of research suggest additional roles for cholinergic systems in overall brain homeostasis and plasticity. As such, the brain’s cholinergic system occupies a central role in ongoing research related to normal cognition and age-related cognitive decline, including dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease. The cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease centres on the progressive loss of limbic and neocortical cholinergic innervation. Neurofibrillary degeneration in the basal forebrain is believed to be the primary cause for the dysfunction and death of forebrain cholinergic neurons, giving rise to a widespread presynaptic cholinergic denervation. Cholinesterase inhibitors increase the availability of acetylcholine at synapses in the brain and are one of the few drug therapies that have been proven clinically useful in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease dementia, thus validating the cholinergic system as an important therapeutic target in the disease. This review includes an overview of the role of the cholinergic system in cognition and an updated understanding of how cholinergic deficits in Alzheimer’s disease interact with other aspects of disease pathophysiology, including plaques composed of amyloid-β proteins. This review also documents the benefits of cholinergic therapies at various stages of Alzheimer’s disease and during long-term follow-up as visualized in novel imaging studies. The weight of the evidence supports the continued value of cholinergic drugs as a standard, cornerstone pharmacological approach in Alzheimer’s disease, particularly as we look ahead to future combination therapies that address symptoms as well as disease progression.},

Furthermore, the sporadic type represents the most common form of AD. Therefore, the establishment of a non-transgenic animal model that resembles the characteristics of the disease is of particular importance. Scopolamine has been linked to increases in both Aβ production and oxidative stress in rat and mice brains. Thus, the purpose of the present work was to identify changes in biomarkers that are related to AD after chronic administration of scopolamine (2~mg/kg i.p., during 6 and 12~weeks) to male Wistar rats. The results showed increased Aβ deposition at rat hippocampus which could be due to an increase of β-site amyloid-β-protein precursor cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression and activity. These findings could be related to the increase of glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylated (GSK3βP9) expression. Finally, the establishment of a state of oxidative stress in groups treated with scopolamine was demonstrated by an increase in free radical content and MDA levels. The present study facilitates our understanding of the changes that occur in biomolecules related to AD in Wistar rats after the chronic administration of scopolamine.},

In a prospective observational study, 283 sleep-disordered patients referred to a hospital-based sleep laboratory for various indications over a 1-year period were evaluated vis-à-vis fatigue and sleepiness. All patients completed five subjective questionnaires, underwent objective sleep recording and attended a clinical interview with a sleep specialist. The subjective questionnaires included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Toronto Hospital Alertness Test, the Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. Only 4\% of the total sample was referred to the sleep clinic due to a complaint of excessive fatigue compared with 17\% for excessive daytime sleepiness. However, during the assessment, 64\% of referred patients reported pathological fatigue without overlap of sleepiness and only 4\% reported pathological sleepiness without overlap of fatigue. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated a weak association (r = 0.18) between subjective fatigue and sleepiness in the total sample. Analysis of variance testing showed strong association between those patients with prominent fatigue and depressive symptoms (P {$<$} 0.01) and illness intrusiveness (P {$<$} 0.001). The findings support the notion that subjective fatigue and sleepiness can be independent manifestations of sleep disorders. Furthermore, predominantly fatigued individuals with sleep disorders seem vulnerable to additional negative consequences due to possible interplay between amplified fatigue and psychological distress.},

  abstract = {In 2011, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association created separate diagnostic recommendations for the preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease. Scientific progress in the interim led to an initiative by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association to update and unify the 2011 guidelines. This unifying update is labeled a “research framework” because its intended use is for observational and interventional research, not routine clinical care. In the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association Research Framework, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by its underlying pathologic processes that can be documented by postmortem examination or in~vivo by biomarkers. The diagnosis is not based on the clinical consequences of the disease (i.e., symptoms/signs) in this research framework, which shifts the definition of AD in living people from a syndromal to a biological construct. The research framework focuses on the diagnosis of AD with biomarkers in living persons. Biomarkers are grouped into those of β amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration [AT(N)]. This ATN classification system groups different biomarkers (imaging and biofluids) by the pathologic process each measures. The AT(N) system is flexible in that new biomarkers can be added to the three existing AT(N) groups, and new biomarker groups beyond AT(N) can be added when they become available. We focus on AD as a continuum, and cognitive staging may be accomplished using continuous measures. However, we also outline two different categorical cognitive schemes for staging the severity of cognitive impairment: a scheme using three traditional syndromal categories and a six-stage numeric scheme. It is important to stress that this framework seeks to create a common language with which investigators can generate and test hypotheses about the interactions among different pathologic processes (denoted by biomarkers) and cognitive symptoms. We appreciate the concern that this biomarker-based research framework has the potential to be misused. Therefore, we emphasize, first, it is premature and inappropriate to use this research framework in general medical practice. Second, this research framework should not be used to restrict alternative approaches to hypothesis testing that do not use biomarkers. There will be situations where biomarkers are not available or requiring them would be counterproductive to the specific research goals (discussed in more detail later in the document). Thus, biomarker-based research should not be considered a template for all research into age-related cognitive impairment and dementia; rather, it should be applied when it is fit for the purpose of the specific research goals of a study. Importantly, this framework should be examined in diverse populations. Although it is possible that β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits are not causal in AD pathogenesis, it is these abnormal protein deposits that define AD as a unique neurodegenerative disease among different disorders that can lead to dementia. We envision that defining AD as a biological construct will enable a more accurate characterization and understanding of the sequence of events that lead to cognitive impairment that is associated with AD, as well as the multifactorial etiology of dementia. This approach also will enable a more precise approach to interventional trials where specific pathways can be targeted in the disease process and in the appropriate people.},

  abstract = {Technologies for imaging the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD) now permit~studies of the relationships between the two major proteins deposited in this disease — amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau — and their effects on measures of neurodegeneration and cognition in~humans. Deposition of Aβ in the medial parietal cortex appears to be the first stage in the development of AD, although tau aggregates in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) precede Aβ deposition in cognitively healthy older people. Whether aggregation of tau in the MTL is the first stage in AD or a fairly benign phenomenon that may be transformed and spread in the presence of Aβ is a major unresolved question. Despite a strong link between Aβ and tau, the relationship between Aβ and neurodegeneration is weak; rather, it is tau that is associated with brain atrophy and hypometabolism, which, in turn, are related to cognition. Although there is support for an interaction between Aβ and tau resulting in neurodegeneration that leads to dementia, the unknown nature of this interaction, the strikingly different patterns of brain Aβ and tau deposition and the appearance of neurodegeneration in the absence of Aβ and tau are challenges to this model that ultimately must be explained.},

  abstract = {Fatigue is a constant occupational hazard for drivers and it greatly reduces efficiency and performance when one persists in continuing the current activity. Studies have investigated various physiological associations with fatigue to try to identify fatigue indicators. The current study assessed the four electroencephalography (EEG) activities, delta (δ), theta (θ), alpha (α) and beta (β), during a monotonous driving session in 52 subjects (36 males and 16 females). Performance of four algorithms, which were: algorithm (i) (θ+α)/β, algorithm (ii) α/β, algorithm (iii) (θ+α)/(α+β), and algorithm (iv) θ/β, were also assessed as possible indicators for fatigue detection. Results showed stable delta and theta activities over time, a slight decrease of alpha activity, and a significant decrease of beta activity (p{$<$}0.05). All four algorithms showed an increase in the ratio of slow wave to fast wave EEG activities over time. Algorithm (i) (θ+α)/β showed a larger increase. The results have implications for detecting fatigue. Impact on industry: The results of this research have the implication for detecting fatigue and can be used for future development of fatigue countermeasure devices.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS) is frequently used for evaluating subjective sleepiness. The main aim of the present study was to investigate the validity and reliability of the KSS with electroencephalographic, behavioral and other subjective indicators of sleepiness. METHODS: Participants were 16 healthy females aged 33-43 (38.1+/-2.68) years. The experiment involved 8 measurement sessions per day for 3 consecutive days. Each session contained the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), the Karolinska drowsiness test (KDT-EEG alpha \& theta power), the alpha attenuation test (AAT-alpha power ratio open/closed eyes) and the KSS. RESULTS: Median reaction time, number of lapses, alpha and theta power density and the alpha attenuation coefficients (AAC) showed highly significant increase with increasing KSS. The same variables were also significantly correlated with KSS, with a mean value for lapses (r=0.56). CONCLUSIONS: The KSS was closely related to EEG and behavioral variables, indicating a high validity in measuring sleepiness. SIGNIFICANCE: KSS ratings may be a useful proxy for EEG or behavioral indicators of sleepiness.},

However, while Aβ may contribute to disease, genetic, clinical, imaging and biochemical data suggest a more complex aetiology.Here we review the history and weaknesses of the amyloid cascade hypothesis in view of the new evidence obtained from clinical trials of anti-amyloid antibodies. These trials indicate that the treatments have either no or uncertain clinical effect on cognition. Despite the importance of amyloid in the definition of Alzheimer’s disease, we argue that the data point to Aβ playing a minor aetiological role.We also discuss data suggesting that the concerted activity of many pathogenic factors contribute to Alzheimer’s disease and propose that evolving multi-factor disease models will better underpin the search for more effective strategies to treat the disease.},

  abstract = {Amyloid β (Aβ) oligomers are derived from proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and can impair memory and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in vivo and in vitro. They are recognized as the primary neurotoxic agents in Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms underlying such toxicity on synaptic functions are complex and not fully understood. Here, we provide the first evidence that these mechanisms involve protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Using a novel transgenic mouse model expressing human APP with the Swedish and Arctic mutations that render Aβ more prone to form oligomers (arcAβ mice), we show that the LTP impairment induced by Aβ oligomers can be fully reversed by PP1 inhibition in vitro. We further demonstrate that the genetic inhibition of endogenous PP1 in vivo confers resistance to Aβ oligomer-mediated toxicity and preserves LTP. Overall, these results reveal that PP1 is a key player in the mechanisms of AD pathology.},

  abstract = {Background Amyloid protein precursor (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2) mutations cause autosomal dominant forms of early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD-EOAD). Although these genes were identified in the 1990s, variant classification remains a challenge, highlighting the need to colligate mutations from large series. Methods and findings We report here a novel update (2012–2016) of the genetic screening of the large AD-EOAD series ascertained across 28 French hospitals from 1993 onwards, bringing the total number of families with identified mutations to n = 170. Families were included when at least two first-degree relatives suffered from early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) with an age of onset (AOO) ≤65 y in two generations. Furthermore, we also screened 129 sporadic cases of Alzheimer disease with an AOO below age 51 (44\% males, mean AOO = 45 ± 2 y). APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 mutations were identified in 53 novel AD-EOAD families. Of the 129 sporadic cases screened, 17 carried a PSEN1 mutation and 1 carried an APP duplication (13\%). Parental DNA was available for 10 sporadic mutation carriers, allowing us to show that the mutation had occurred de novo in each case. Thirteen mutations (12 in PSEN1 and 1 in PSEN2) identified either in familial or in sporadic cases were previously unreported. Of the 53 mutation carriers with available cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, 46 (87\%) had all three CSF biomarkers—total tau protein (Tau), phospho-tau protein (P-Tau), and amyloid β (Aβ)42—in abnormal ranges. No mutation carrier had the three biomarkers in normal ranges. One limitation of this study is the absence of functional assessment of the possibly and probably pathogenic variants, which should help their classification. Conclusions Our findings suggest that a nonnegligible fraction of PSEN1 mutations occurs de novo, which is of high importance for genetic counseling, as PSEN1 mutational screening is currently performed in familial cases only. Among the 90 distinct mutations found in the whole sample of families and isolated cases, definite pathogenicity is currently established for only 77\%, emphasizing the need to pursue the effort to classify variants.},

Therefore, disruption of cholinergic neurotransmission with scopolamine may unmask otherwise undetectable cognitive deficits in preclinical AD. To compare the effects of low-dose (0.20~mg s.c.) scopolamine on cognition between Aβ+ and Aβ− cognitively normal (CN) older adults using the Groton Maze Learning Test (GMLT). CN older adults completed the GMLT predose and then received scopolamine (0.20~mg) subcutaneously. Participants were reassessed 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 8-hours post dose. All participants underwent positron emission tomography neuroimaging for Aβ using 18F-florbetapir within 6~weeks of their baseline visit. Rhode Island Hospital Clinical Research Center, Providence, USA. CN older adults (n~= 63), with a family history of AD and subjective memory complaints were enrolled (15 were classified as Aβ+ and 48 were classified as Aβ−). Cognition was assessed using the computerized GMLT at all predose and post-dose time points. At 5-hours post dose, the Aβ+ group performed significantly worse than the Aβ− group on all measures of learning efficiency and working memory and/or executive function (Cohen's d~= 1.13–1.56). When participants were classified as having an abnormal response to scopolamine (based on change score at 5-hours post dose {$>$}0), 100\% were correctly classified as Aβ+ and 67\% as Aβ−. The results of this study suggest that diminished cholinergic tone likely occurs in preclinical AD, and as such, the use of a cholinergic stress test to perturb an already compromised neurotransmitter system may be an effective way of identifying CN older adults who are in this preclinical stage of AD.},

Methods Fifty-one insomnia patients and 53 HC underwent 6 nights of polysomnography. Four methods for estimating Delta Decline were compared (exponential and linear best-fit functions using NREM (1) episode mean, (2) peak, and (3) total delta power and (4) delta power for all available NREM epochs). The best method was applied to compare groups on linear and exponential rates of Delta Decline. Results Best-fit models using all available NREM epochs were significantly less vulnerable to deviation due to missing data than other methods. Insomnia patients displayed significantly slower linear and exponential Delta Decline than HC. Conclusions Computing Delta Decline using all available NREM epochs was the best of the methods studied for minimizing the effects of missing data. Insomnia patients display slower Delta Decline, which is not explained by differences in total sleep time or wake after sleep onset. Significance This study supports using all available NREM epochs in Delta Decline computation and suggests a slower rate in insomnia.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of adult-onset dementia is characterized by a progressive decline of cognitive functions accompanied by behavioral manifestations. The main class of drugs currently used for the treatment of AD are acetylcholinesterase/cholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-Is). The first ChE-I licensed for symptomatic treatment of AD was tacrine. The ChE-Is currently available in the market are donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine as tacrine is no longer in use, due to its hepatotoxicity. According to mechanism of action the ChE-Is are classified as short-acting or reversible agents such as tacrine, donepezil, and galantamine, as intermediate-acting or pseudo-irreversible agent such as rivastigmine. Overall, the efficacy of the three ChE-Is available in the market is similar and the benefit of administration of these compounds is mild and may not be clinically significant. Due to gastrointestinal side effects of these drugs, medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical delivery studies have investigated solutions to improve the pharmacological activity of these compounds. In spite of the limited activity of ChE-Is, waiting for more effective approaches, these drugs still represent a pharmacotherapeutic resource for the treatment of AD. Other approaches in which ChE-Is were investigated is in their use in combination with other classes of drugs such as cholinergic precursors, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and antioxidant agents. After many years from the introduction in therapy of ChE-Is, the combination with other classes of drugs may represent the chance for a renewed interest of ChE-Is in the treatment of adult-onset dementia disorders.},

  abstract = {Introduction Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its prevalence is unclear because earlier studies did not require biomarker evidence of amyloid β (Aβ) pathology. Methods We included 3451 Aβ+ subjects (853 AD-type dementia, 1810 mild cognitive impairment, and 788 cognitively normal). Generalized estimating equation models were used to assess APOE ε4 prevalence in relation to age, sex, education, and geographical location. Results The APOE ε4 prevalence was 66\% in AD-type dementia, 64\% in mild cognitive impairment, and 51\% in cognitively normal, and it decreased with advancing age in Aβ+ cognitively normal and Aβ+ mild cognitive impairment (P {$<$} .05) but not in Aβ+ AD dementia (P = .66). The prevalence was highest in Northern Europe but did not vary by sex or education. Discussion The APOE ε4 prevalence in AD was higher than that in previous studies, which did not require presence of Aβ pathology. Furthermore, our results highlight disease heterogeneity related to age and geographical location.},

Each group included 6 men and 6 women.None.A polysomnography night of 8 hours in duration was recorded according to preferred sleep schedule. Sleep-stage analysis revealed that morning types and evening types did not differ in sleep architecture. However, morning-type men showed a higher percentage of stage 1 sleep and lower sleep efficiency than evening-type men. Electroencephalogram spectral analysis was conducted in non-rapid eye movement sleep for 6 frequency bands. Morning types had more spectral power in low sigma (12-14 Hz) compared with evening types. The most robust difference between women and men was found in high sigma (14-16 Hz) and was not present between chronotypes. The decay rate of slow-wave activity (1-5 Hz) tended to be faster in morning types compared with evening types (P = .06). This rate was almost identical for women and men.These results agree with the hypothesis that homeostatic sleep regulation differs between morning types and evening types, with morning types showing indications of a higher rate of dissipation of sleep pressure during the night. Morningness-eveningness seems to affect sleep in a sex-specific manner, with men being more affected by their chronotype.},

Imaging data and CSF samples were reprocessed as appropriate to guarantee uniform pipelines and assays. Data analyses yielded rates of change before and after symptomatic onset of Alzheimer's disease, allowing the alignment of the ∼30-year age difference between the cohorts on a clinically meaningful anchor point, namely the participant age at symptomatic onset.Biomarker profiles were similar for both autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease and late onset Alzheimer's disease. Both groups demonstrated accelerated rates of decline in cognitive performance and in regional brain volume loss after symptomatic onset. Although amyloid burden accumulation as determined by PET was greater after symptomatic onset in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease than in late onset Alzheimer's disease participants, CSF assays of amyloid-β42, amyloid-β40, tau and p-tau181 were largely overlapping in both groups. Rates of change in cognitive performance and hippocampal volume loss after symptomatic onset were more aggressive for autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease participants.These findings suggest a similar pathophysiology of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease and late onset Alzheimer's disease, supporting a shared pathobiological construct.},

The risk of Alzheimer's disease is 60–80\% dependent on heritable factors, with more than 40 Alzheimer's disease-associated genetic risk loci already identified, of which the APOE alleles have the strongest association with the disease. Novel biomarkers include PET scans and plasma assays for amyloid β and phosphorylated tau, which show great promise for clinical and research use. Multidomain lifestyle-based prevention trials suggest cognitive benefits in participants with increased risk of dementia. Lifestyle factors do not directly affect Alzheimer's disease pathology, but can still contribute to a positive outcome in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Promising pharmacological treatments are poised at advanced stages of clinical trials and include anti-amyloid β, anti-tau, and anti-inflammatory strategies.},

Antibody-based immunotherapy against Aβ to trigger its clearance or mitigate its neurotoxicity has so far been unsuccessful. Here we report the generation of aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets aggregated Aβ. In a transgenic mouse model of AD, aducanumab is shown to enter the brain, bind parenchymal Aβ, and reduce soluble and insoluble Aβ in a dose-dependent manner. In patients with prodromal or mild AD, one year of monthly intravenous infusions of aducanumab reduces brain Aβ in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This is accompanied by a slowing of clinical decline measured by Clinical Dementia Rating—Sum of Boxes and Mini Mental State Examination scores. The main safety and tolerability findings are amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. These results justify further development of aducanumab for the treatment of AD. Should the slowing of clinical decline be confirmed in ongoing phase 3 clinical trials, it would provide compelling support for the amyloid hypothesis.},

In this cross sectional study we investigated brain perfusion changes after 18~months of treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) donepezil or galantamine. Twenty-five drug-naïve late-onset AD patients were recruited from outpatient clinics. We examined brain perfusion using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and used three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection (3D-SSP) and the stereotactic extraction estimation method (SEE) level 3 to analyze classified gyrus level segments. We assessed cognitive function using the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) grouped into three subgroup domains, language, memory, and praxis. In the follow-up data, some regions were further hypoperfused, reflecting worsening of the disease, while other regions showed alleviated hypoperfusion, potentially related to the ChEIs treatment. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) decreased in the parietal cortex and increased in the frontal and the limbic cortices. Increased hypoperfusion significantly correlated with ADAS-cog scores changes were seen in the superior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule, angular gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus of the parietal cortex. Alleviated hypoperfusion significantly related to recovery of ADAS-cog scores were seen in the rectal and paracentral lobule of the frontal cortex, and the anterior cingulate of the limbic cortex. These regions showed significant relationships with total ADAS-cog and language, memory and praxis subscales scores. The current longitudinal study indicates prominent rCBF changes and their relationships with changes in ADAS-cog scores in late-onset AD patients.},

Genetic association provides a robust platform to build our understanding of the etiology of this complex disease. Over 50 loci are now implicated for AD, suggesting that AD is a disease of multiple components, as supported by pathway analyses (immunity, endocytosis, cholesterol transport, ubiquitination, amyloid-β and tau processing). Over 50\% of late-onset AD heritability has been captured, allowing researchers to calculate the accumulation of AD genetic risk through polygenic risk scores. A polygenic risk score predicts disease with up to 90\% accuracy and is an exciting tool in our research armory that could allow selection of those with high polygenic risk scores for clinical trials and precision medicine. It could also allow cellular modelling of the combined risk. Here we propose the multiplex model as a new perspective from which to understand AD. The multiplex model reflects the combination of some, or all, of these model components (genetic and environmental), in a tissue-specific manner, to trigger or sustain a disease cascade, which ultimately results in the cell and synaptic loss observed in AD.},

However, because of the absence of standardization, the conclusions that can be drawn about NRS based on the current body of empirical literature are limited. A feeling of being unrefreshed upon awakening that is not accounted for by lack of sleep may occur among a substantial percentage of the population. This experience is correlated with daytime impairment, pain, fatigue, and electroencephalogram (EEG) arousals in non-REM sleep but causal links are unsubstantiated. An immediate converging of researchers toward NRS standardization is needed. We conclude that conceptualizing NRS as a primary symptom of insomnia on par with difficulty initiating sleep and difficulty maintaining sleep is empirically unsubstantiated. We recommend defining NRS as a report of persistently feeling unrefreshed upon awakening in the presence of a normal sleep duration, occurring in the absence of a sleep disorder.},

  abstract = {Introduction Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are the two most prevalent sleep disorders, and frequently co-occur (COMISA) in sleep clinic samples. However, few studies have investigated the prevalence or associations of COMISA in the general population. Methods We used population-based online survey data from 2044 Australian adults. The prevalence and associations of insomnia, OSA and COMISA were investigated according to symptom-level, and disorder-level definitions. Insomnia was defined according to chronic difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep (DIMS; symptom-level), and ICSD-3 chronic insomnia disorder (disorder-level). OSA was defined according to self-reported frequent obstructive events, snoring or doctor-diagnosed OSA (symptom-level), and doctor-diagnosed OSA (disorder-level). COMISA was defined if both conditions were met (for symptom-level, and disorder-level threshold). Associations with other conditions, and general health were investigated with Poisson regression analyses. Results Chronic insomnia occurred more frequently among participants with doctor-diagnosed OSA (22.3\%), compared to those without (14.3\%, p~=~0.010). Doctor-diagnosed OSA was more common among participants with chronic insomnia (10.2\%) compared to those without (6.2\%; p~=~0.010). DIMS also occurred more frequently among participants with OSA symptoms (66.6\%), compared to those without (47.2\%; p~{$<~$}0.001). Participants with symptom-level COMISA reported increased co-morbid conditions, and worse general health compared to participants with symptoms of insomnia-alone, OSA-alone, or neither insomnia/OSA. Conclusions COMISA at symptom and disorder level were common and associated with increased medical and psychiatric co-morbidity, as well as poor general health. More investigation is required to understand bi-directional associations underpinning the high co-morbidity, and improve diagnostic and treatment approaches for COMISA to reduce associated morbidity.},

  abstract = {In 2021, aducanumab, an immunotherapy targeting amyloid-β, was approved for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the US Food and Drug Administration thanks to positive results on a putative biological surrogate marker. This approval has raised an unprecedented controversy. It was followed by a refusal of the European Medicine Agency, which does not allow the marketing of drugs solely on biological arguments and raised safety issues, and important US coverage limitations by the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services. Two other anti-amyloid immunotherapies showed significant results regarding a clinical outcome in phase 2 trials, and five drugs are being studied in phase 3 trials. Compared to those tested in previous trials of the 2010s, the common feature and novelty of these anti-amyloid immunotherapies is their ability to induce a high clearance of amyloid load, as measured with positron emission tomography, in the brain of early-stage biomarker-proven AD patients. Here, we review the available evidence regarding efficacy and safety data and medico-economical aspects for high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies. We also perform frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses of the clinical efficacy and safety of the highest dose groups from the two aducanumab phase 3 trials and the donanemab and lecanemab phase 2 trials. When pooled together, the data from high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies trials confirm a statistically significant clinical effect of these drugs on cognitive decline after 18 months (difference in cognitive decline measured with CDR-SB after 18 months between the high dose immunotherapy groups vs. placebo~=~−0.24 points; P=0.04, frequentist random-effect model), with results on ADAS-Cog being the most statistically robust. However, this effect remains below the previously established minimal clinically relevant values. In parallel, the drugs significantly increased the occurrence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema (ARIA-E: risk ratio=13.39; P{$<$}0.0001), ARIA-hemorrhage (risk ratio=2.78; P=0.0002), and symptomatic and serious ARIA (7/1321=0.53\% in the high dose groups versus 0/1446 in the placebo groups; risk ratio=6.44; P=0.04). The risk/benefit ratio of high-clearance immunotherapies in early AD is so far questionable after 18 months. Identifying subgroups of better responders, the perspective of combination therapies, and a longer follow-up may help improve their clinical relevance. Finally, the preliminary evidence from medico-economical analyses seems to indicate that the current cost of aducanumab in the US is not in reasonable alignment with its clinical benefits.},

Compared with standard-dose donepezil, there was no difference in the incidence of adverse events when high-dose donepezil was used. However, it was found that high-dose donepezil administration increased the risk of heart problems through subgroup analysis of the two serious adverse events. High-dose donepezil is more effective than standard-dose donepezil in improving cognitive function of the elderly with moderate-to-severe AD.

For EOAD (n~=~702), we found that the parent-offspring concordance was 10\% or less and concordance among siblings was 21.6\%. Early-onset AD heritability was 92\% to 100\% for all likely values of EOAD prevalence.We confirm late-onset AD is a highly polygenic disease. By contrast, the data for EOAD suggest it is an almost entirely genetically based disease, and the patterns of observed concordance for parent-offspring pairs and among siblings lead us to reject the hypotheses that EOAD is a purely dominant, mitochondrial, X-linked, or polygenic disorder. The most likely explanation of the data is that approximately 90\% of EOAD cases are due to autosomal recessive causes.},

  abstract = {Recent human trials of treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have been largely unsuccessful, raising the idea that treatment may need to be started earlier in the disease, well before cognitive symptoms appear. An early marker of AD pathology is therefore needed and it is debated as to whether amyloid-βAβ? plaque load may serve this purpose. We investigated this in the hAPP-J20 AD mouse model by studying disease pathology at 6, 12, 24 and 36 weeks. Using robust stereological methods, we found there is no neuron loss in the hippocampal CA3 region at any age. However loss of neurons from the hippocampal CA1 region begins as early as 12 weeks of age. The extent of neuron loss increases with age, correlating with the number of activated microglia. Gliosis was also present, but plateaued during aging. Increased hyperactivity and spatial memory deficits occurred at 16 and 24 weeks. Meanwhile, the appearance of plaques and oligomeric Aβ were essentially the last pathological changes, with significant changes only observed at 36 weeks of age. This is surprising given that the hAPP-J20 AD mouse model is engineered to over-expresses Aβ. Our data raises the possibility that plaque load may not be the best marker for early AD and suggests that activated microglia could be a valuable marker to track disease progression.},

  abstract = {Amyloid β-protein (Aβ) molecules tend to aggregate and subsequently form low MW (LMW) oligomers, high MW (HMW) aggregates such as protofibrils, and ultimately fibrils. These Aβ species can generally form amyloid plaques implicated in the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer disease (AD), but therapies designed to reduce plaque load have not demonstrated clinical efficacy. Recent evidence implicates amyloid oligomers in AD neuropathology, but the precise mechanisms are uncertain. We examined the mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction from HMW-Aβ1-42 exposure by measuring membrane integrity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, membrane lipid peroxidation, membrane fluidity, intracellular calcium regulation, passive membrane electrophysiological properties, and long-term potentiation (LTP). HMW-Aβ1-42 disturbed membrane integrity by inducing ROS generation and lipid peroxidation, resulting in decreased membrane fluidity, intracellular calcium dysregulation, depolarization, and impaired LTP. The damaging effects of HMW-Aβ1-42 were significantly greater than those of LMW-Aβ1-42. Therapeutic reduction of HMW-Aβ1-42 may prevent AD progression by ameliorating direct neuronal membrane damage.-Yasumoto, T., Takamura, Y., Tsuji, M., Watanabe-Nakayama, T., Imamura, K., Inoue, H., Nakamura, S., Inoue, T., Kimura, A., Yano, S., Nishijo, H., Kiuchi, Y., Teplow, D.

  abstract = {A large body of evidence has shown that cognitive deficits occur early, before amyloid plaque deposition, suggesting that soluble amyloid-β protein (Aβ) contributes to the development of early cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanism(s) through which soluble Aβ exerts its neurotoxicity responsible for cognitive dysfunction in the early stage of AD remains unclear so far. In this study, we used preplaque APPswe/PS1dE9 mice ages 2.5 and 3.5months to examine alterations in cognitive function, oxidative stress, and cholinergic function. We found that only soluble Aβ, not insoluble Aβ, was detected in these preplaque APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice 2.5months of age did not show any significant changes in the measures of cognitive function, oxidative stress, and cholinergic function, whereas 3.5-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice exhibited spatial memory impairment in the Morris water maze, accompanied by significantly decreased acetylcholine (ACh), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) as well as increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls. In 3.5-month-old preplaque APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, correlational analyses revealed that the performance of impaired spatial memory was inversely correlated with soluble Aβ, MDA, and protein carbonyls, as well as being positively correlated with ACh, ChAT, SOD, and GSH-px; soluble Aβ level was inversely correlated with ACh, ChAT, SOD, and GSH-px, as well as being positively correlated with MDA and protein carbonyls; ACh level showed a significant positive correlation with ChAT, SOD, and GSH-px, as well as a significant inverse correlation with MDA and protein carbonyls. Collectively, this study provides direct evidence that increased oxidative damage and cholinergic dysfunction may be early pathological responses to soluble Aβ and involved in early memory deficits in the preplaque stage of AD. These findings suggest that early antioxidant therapy and improving cholinergic function may be a promising strategy to prevent or delay the onset and progression of AD.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS) is frequently used for evaluating subjective sleepiness. The main aim of the present study was to investigate the validity and reliability of the KSS with electroencephalographic, behavioral and other subjective indicators of sleepiness. METHODS: Participants were 16 healthy females aged 33-43 (38.1+/-2.68) years. The experiment involved 8 measurement sessions per day for 3 consecutive days. Each session contained the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), the Karolinska drowsiness test (KDT-EEG alpha \& theta power), the alpha attenuation test (AAT-alpha power ratio open/closed eyes) and the KSS. RESULTS: Median reaction time, number of lapses, alpha and theta power density and the alpha attenuation coefficients (AAC) showed highly significant increase with increasing KSS. The same variables were also significantly correlated with KSS, with a mean value for lapses (r=0.56). CONCLUSIONS: The KSS was closely related to EEG and behavioral variables, indicating a high validity in measuring sleepiness. SIGNIFICANCE: KSS ratings may be a useful proxy for EEG or behavioral indicators of sleepiness.},

  abstract = {Introduction Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are the two most prevalent sleep disorders, and frequently co-occur (COMISA) in sleep clinic samples. However, few studies have investigated the prevalence or associations of COMISA in the general population. Methods We used population-based online survey data from 2044 Australian adults. The prevalence and associations of insomnia, OSA and COMISA were investigated according to symptom-level, and disorder-level definitions. Insomnia was defined according to chronic difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep (DIMS; symptom-level), and ICSD-3 chronic insomnia disorder (disorder-level). OSA was defined according to self-reported frequent obstructive events, snoring or doctor-diagnosed OSA (symptom-level), and doctor-diagnosed OSA (disorder-level). COMISA was defined if both conditions were met (for symptom-level, and disorder-level threshold). Associations with other conditions, and general health were investigated with Poisson regression analyses. Results Chronic insomnia occurred more frequently among participants with doctor-diagnosed OSA (22.3\%), compared to those without (14.3\%, p~=~0.010). Doctor-diagnosed OSA was more common among participants with chronic insomnia (10.2\%) compared to those without (6.2\%; p~=~0.010). DIMS also occurred more frequently among participants with OSA symptoms (66.6\%), compared to those without (47.2\%; p~{$<~$}0.001). Participants with symptom-level COMISA reported increased co-morbid conditions, and worse general health compared to participants with symptoms of insomnia-alone, OSA-alone, or neither insomnia/OSA. Conclusions COMISA at symptom and disorder level were common and associated with increased medical and psychiatric co-morbidity, as well as poor general health. More investigation is required to understand bi-directional associations underpinning the high co-morbidity, and improve diagnostic and treatment approaches for COMISA to reduce associated morbidity.},

  abstract = {Although daytime complaints are a defining characteristic of insomnia, most EEG studies evaluated sleep only. We used high-density electroencephalography to investigate wake resting state oscillations characteristic of insomnia disorder (ID) at a fine-grained spatiospectral resolution.A case-control assessment during eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) was performed in a laboratory for human physiology. Participants (n = 94, 74 female, 21–70 y) were recruited through www.sleepregistry.nl: 51 with ID, according to DSM-5 and 43 matched controls. Exclusion criteria were any somatic, neurological or psychiatric condition. Group differences in the spectral power topographies across multiple frequencies (1.5 to 40 Hz) were evaluated using permutation-based inference with Threshold-Free Cluster-Enhancement, to correct for multiple comparisons.As compared to controls, participants with ID showed less power in a narrow upper alpha band (11–12.7 Hz, peak: 11.7 Hz) over bilateral frontal and left temporal regions during EO, and more power in a broad beta frequency range (16.3–40 Hz, peak: 19 Hz) globally during EC. Source estimates suggested global rather than cortically localized group differences.The widespread high power in a broad beta band reported previously during sleep in insomnia is present as well during eyes closed wakefulness, suggestive of a round-the-clock hyperarousal. Low power in the upper alpha band during eyes open is consistent with low cortical inhibition and attentional filtering. The fine-grained HD-EEG findings suggest that, while more feasible than PSG, wake EEG of short duration with a few well-chosen electrodes and frequency bands, can provide valuable features of insomnia.Whereas round-the-clock hyperarousal is considered characteristic of insomnia, its representation in wake EEG is insufficiently known. We compared the spatiospectral properties of high-density wake EEG of 51 people with insomnia and 43 matched controls without sleep complaints. Just as previously reported during sleep, people with insomnia show widespread increased beta power during eyes closed wakefulness. During eyes open, their EEG moreover shows relatively little power in a narrow band in the upper-alpha range. The low correlation between these two features suggests they may reflect distinct processes, respectively high arousal and low inhibition. Future studies may employ these measures to evaluate subtypes of insomnia and relevance for variability in profiles of complaints about sleep and daytime functioning.},

Each group included 6 men and 6 women.None.A polysomnography night of 8 hours in duration was recorded according to preferred sleep schedule. Sleep-stage analysis revealed that morning types and evening types did not differ in sleep architecture. However, morning-type men showed a higher percentage of stage 1 sleep and lower sleep efficiency than evening-type men. Electroencephalogram spectral analysis was conducted in non-rapid eye movement sleep for 6 frequency bands. Morning types had more spectral power in low sigma (12-14 Hz) compared with evening types. The most robust difference between women and men was found in high sigma (14-16 Hz) and was not present between chronotypes. The decay rate of slow-wave activity (1-5 Hz) tended to be faster in morning types compared with evening types (P = .06). This rate was almost identical for women and men.These results agree with the hypothesis that homeostatic sleep regulation differs between morning types and evening types, with morning types showing indications of a higher rate of dissipation of sleep pressure during the night. Morningness-eveningness seems to affect sleep in a sex-specific manner, with men being more affected by their chronotype.},

Despite lacking a standard, operational definition, NRS is investigated in research studies and included in diagnostic manuals. However, because of the absence of standardization, the conclusions that can be drawn about NRS based on the current body of empirical literature are limited. A feeling of being unrefreshed upon awakening that is not accounted for by lack of sleep may occur among a substantial percentage of the population. This experience is correlated with daytime impairment, pain, fatigue, and electroencephalogram (EEG) arousals in non-REM sleep but causal links are unsubstantiated. An immediate converging of researchers toward NRS standardization is needed. We conclude that conceptualizing NRS as a primary symptom of insomnia on par with difficulty initiating sleep and difficulty maintaining sleep is empirically unsubstantiated. We recommend defining NRS as a report of persistently feeling unrefreshed upon awakening in the presence of a normal sleep duration, occurring in the absence of a sleep disorder.},

Methods Fifty-one insomnia patients and 53 HC underwent 6 nights of polysomnography. Four methods for estimating Delta Decline were compared (exponential and linear best-fit functions using NREM (1) episode mean, (2) peak, and (3) total delta power and (4) delta power for all available NREM epochs). The best method was applied to compare groups on linear and exponential rates of Delta Decline. Results Best-fit models using all available NREM epochs were significantly less vulnerable to deviation due to missing data than other methods. Insomnia patients displayed significantly slower linear and exponential Delta Decline than HC. Conclusions Computing Delta Decline using all available NREM epochs was the best of the methods studied for minimizing the effects of missing data. Insomnia patients display slower Delta Decline, which is not explained by differences in total sleep time or wake after sleep onset. Significance This study supports using all available NREM epochs in Delta Decline computation and suggests a slower rate in insomnia.},

  abstract = {The main consequence of insufficient sleep is sleepiness. While measures of sleep latency, continuous encephalographical/electro-oculographical (EEG/EOG) recording and performance tests are useful indicators of sleepiness in the laboratory and clinic, they are not easily implemented in large, real-life field studies. Subjective ratings of sleepiness, which are easily applied and unobtrusive, are an alternative, but whether they measure sleepiness sensitively, reliably and validly remains uncertain. This review brings together research relevant to these issues. It is focused on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), which is a nine-point Likert-type scale. The diurnal pattern of sleepiness is U-shaped, with high KSS values in the morning and late evening, and with great stability across years. KSS values increase sensitively during acute total and repeated partial sleep deprivation and night work, including night driving. The effect sizes range between 1.5 and 3. The relation to driving performance or EEG/EOG indicators of sleepiness is highly significant, strongly curvilinear and consistent across individuals. High ({$>$}6) KSS values are associated particularly with impaired driving performance and sleep intrusions in the EEG. KSS values are also increased in many clinical conditions such as sleep apnea, depression and burnout. The context has a strong influence on KSS ratings. Thus, physical activity, social interaction and light exposure will reduce KSS values by 1–2 units. In contrast, time-on-task in a monotonous context will increase KSS values by 1–2 units. In summary, subjective ratings of sleepiness as described here is as sensitive and valid an indicator of sleepiness as objective measures, and particularly suitable for field studies.},

  abstract = {The objective of this investigation was to evaluate subjective fatigue versus subjective sleepiness as independent consequences of sleep disorders. Furthermore, we tried to explore how these symptoms relate to alertness, depressive symptoms and illness intrusiveness. In a prospective observational study, 283 sleep-disordered patients referred to a hospital-based sleep laboratory for various indications over a 1-year period were evaluated vis-à-vis fatigue and sleepiness. All patients completed five subjective questionnaires, underwent objective sleep recording and attended a clinical interview with a sleep specialist. The subjective questionnaires included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Toronto Hospital Alertness Test, the Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. Only 4\% of the total sample was referred to the sleep clinic due to a complaint of excessive fatigue compared with 17\% for excessive daytime sleepiness. However, during the assessment, 64\% of referred patients reported pathological fatigue without overlap of sleepiness and only 4\% reported pathological sleepiness without overlap of fatigue. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated a weak association (r = 0.18) between subjective fatigue and sleepiness in the total sample. Analysis of variance testing showed strong association between those patients with prominent fatigue and depressive symptoms (P {$<$} 0.01) and illness intrusiveness (P {$<$} 0.001). The findings support the notion that subjective fatigue and sleepiness can be independent manifestations of sleep disorders. Furthermore, predominantly fatigued individuals with sleep disorders seem vulnerable to additional negative consequences due to possible interplay between amplified fatigue and psychological distress.},

  abstract = {In this first intracellular study of neocortical activities during waking and sleep states, we hypothesized that synaptic activities during natural states of vigilance have a decisive impact on the observed electrophysiological properties of neurons that were previously studied under anesthesia or in brain slices. We investigated the incidence of different firing patterns in neocortical neurons of awake cats, the relation between membrane potential fluctuations and firing rates, and the input resistance during all states of vigilance. In awake animals, the neurons displaying fast-spiking firing patterns were more numerous, whereas the incidence of neurons with intrinsically bursting patterns was much lower than in our previous experiments conducted on the intact-cortex or isolated cortical slabs of anesthetized cats. Although cortical neurons displayed prolonged hyperpolarizing phases during slow-wave sleep, the firing rates during the depolarizing phases of the slow sleep oscillation was as high during these epochs as during waking and rapid-eye-movement sleep. Maximum firing rates, exceeding those of regular-spiking neurons, were reached by conventional fast-spiking neurons during both waking and sleep states, and by fast-rhythmic-bursting neurons during waking. The input resistance was more stable and it increased during quiet wakefulness, compared with sleep states. As waking is associated with high synaptic activity, we explain this result by a higher release of activating neuromodulators, which produce an increase in the input resistance of cortical neurons. In view of the high firing rates in the functionally disconnected state of slow-wave sleep, we suggest that neocortical neurons are engaged in processing internally generated signals.},

  abstract = {Although the EEG slow wave of sleep is typically considered to be a hallmark of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, recent work in mice has shown that slow waves can also occur in REM sleep. Here, we investigated the presence and cortical distribution of negative delta (1–4 Hz) waves in human REM sleep by analyzing high-density EEG sleep recordings obtained in 28 healthy subjects. We identified two clusters of delta waves with distinctive properties: (1) a frontal-central cluster characterized by ∼2.5–3.0 Hz, relatively large, notched delta waves (so-called “sawtooth waves”) that tended to occur in bursts, were associated with increased gamma activity and rapid eye movements (EMs), and upon source modeling displayed an occipital-temporal and a frontal-central component and (2) a medial-occipital cluster characterized by more isolated, slower ({$<$}2 Hz), and smaller waves that were not associated with rapid EMs, displayed a negative correlation with gamma activity, and were also found in NREM sleep. Therefore, delta waves are an integral part of REM sleep in humans and the two identified subtypes (sawtooth and medial-occipital slow waves) may reflect distinct generation mechanisms and functional roles. Sawtooth waves, which are exclusive to REM sleep, share many characteristics with ponto-geniculo-occipital waves described in animals and may represent the human equivalent or a closely related event, whereas medial-occipital slow waves appear similar to NREM sleep slow waves. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The EEG slow wave is typically considered a hallmark of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, but recent work in mice has shown that it can also occur in REM sleep. By analyzing high-density EEG recordings collected in healthy adult individuals, we show that REM sleep is characterized by prominent delta waves also in humans. In particular, we identified two distinctive clusters of delta waves with different properties: a frontal-central cluster characterized by faster, activating “sawtooth waves” that share many characteristics with ponto-geniculo-occipital waves described in animals and a medial-occipital cluster containing slow waves that are more similar to NREM sleep slow waves. These findings indicate that REM sleep is a spatially and temporally heterogeneous state and may contribute to explaining its known functional and phenomenological properties.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a surge in human sleep electroencephalography (EEG) studies, employing increasingly sophisticated analysis strategies to relate electrophysiological activity to cognition and disease. However, properly calculating and interpreting metrics used in contemporary sleep EEG requires attention to numerous theoretical and practical signal-processing details that are not always obvious. Moreover, the vast number of outcome measures that can be derived from a single dataset inflates the risk of false positives and threatens replicability. We review several methodological issues related to 1) spectral analysis, 2) montage choice, 3) extraction of phase and amplitude information, 4) surrogate construction, and 5) minimizing false positives, illustrating both the impact of methodological choices on downstream results, and the importance of checking processing steps through visualization and simplified examples. By presenting these issues in non-mathematical form, with sleep-specific examples, and with code implementation, this paper aims to instill a deeper appreciation of methodological considerations in novice and non-technical audiences, and thereby help improve the quality of future sleep EEG studies.},

  abstract = {We describe a novel slow oscillation in intracellular recordings from cortical association areas 5 and 7, motor areas 4 and 6, and visual areas 17 and 18 of cats under various anesthetics. The recorded neurons (n = 254) were antidromically and orthodromically identified as corticothalamic or callosal elements receiving projections from appropriate thalamic nuclei as well as from homotopic foci in the contralateral cortex. Two major types of cells were recorded: regular- spiking (mainly slow-adapting, but also fast-adapting) neurons and intrinsically bursting cells. A group of slowly oscillating neurons (n = 21) were intracellularly stained and found to be pyramidal-shaped cells in layers III-VI, with luxuriant basal dendritic arbors. The slow rhythm appeared in 88\% of recorded neurons. It consisted of slow depolarizing envelopes (lasting for 0.8–1.5 sec) with superimposed full action potentials or presumed dendritic spikes, followed by long- lasting hyperpolarizations. Such sequences recurred rhythmically at less than 1 Hz, with a prevailing oscillation between 0.3 and 0.4 Hz in 67\% of urethane-anesthetized animals. While in most neurons (approximately 70\%) the repetitive spikes superimposed on the slow depolarization were completely blocked by slight DC hyperpolarization, 30\% of cells were found to display relatively small (3–12 mV), rapid, all-or-none potentials after obliteration of full action potentials. These fast spikes were suppressed in an all-or-none fashion at Vm more negative than -90 mV. The depolarizing envelope of the slow rhythm was reduced or suppressed at a Vm of -90 to -100 mV and its duration was greatly reduced by administration of the NMDA blocker ketamine. In keeping with this action, most (56\%) neurons recorded in animals under ketamine and nitrous oxide or ketamine and xylazine anesthesia displayed the slow oscillation at higher frequencies (0.6–1 Hz) than under urethane anesthesia (0.3–0.4 Hz). In 18\% of the oscillating cells, the slow rhythm mainly consisted of repetitive (15–30 Hz), relatively short-lasting (15–25 msec) IPSPs that could be revealed by bringing the Vm at more positive values than -70 mV. The long-lasting (approximately 1 sec) hyperpolarizing phase of the slow oscillation was best observed at the resting Vm and was reduced at about -100 mV. Simultaneous recording of another cell across the membrane demonstrated synchronous inhibitory periods in both neurons. Intracellular diffusion of Cl- or Cs+ reduced the amplitude and/or duration of cyclic long- lasting hyperpolaryzations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {During much of sleep, virtually all cortical neurons undergo a slow oscillation ({$<$}1 Hz) in membrane potential, cycling from a hyperpolarized state of silence to a depolarized state of intense firing. This slow oscillation is the fundamental cellular phenomenon that organizes other sleep rhythms such as spindles and slow waves. Using high-density electroencephalogram recordings in humans, we show here that each cycle of the slow oscillation is a traveling wave. Each wave originates at a definite site and travels over the scalp at an estimated speed of 1.2-7.0 m/sec. Waves originate more frequently in prefrontal-orbitofrontal regions and propagate in an anteroposterior direction. Their rate of occurrence increases progressively reaching almost once per second as sleep deepens. The pattern of origin and propagation of sleep slow oscillations is reproducible across nights and subjects and provides a blueprint of cortical excitability and connectivity. The orderly propagation of correlated activity along connected pathways may play a role in spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity during sleep.},

The aim of the present study was to test the response to repeated partial sleep loss through detailed focus on spectral data and parts of sleep.The experiment involved 4 h of sleep across 5 days in the laboratory (partial sleep deprivation [PSD]), followed by 3 days of recovery sleep. PSD was achieved through a delayed bedtime. Nine individuals participated. To avoid “laboratory monotony,” subjects were permitted to leave the lab for a few hours each day.All sleep stages and the latencies to sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS) showed a significant reduction during PSD. However, SWS and TST (total sleep time) during the first half of sleep increased gradually across days with PSD. During the first recovery sleep, SWS was significantly increased, while stage 1 and latency to stage 3 were reduced. All were back to baseline on the second night of recovery sleep.Summed spectral power during the first 3.8 h of sleep showed a gradual and robust increase (50\% above baseline) in the range 1.25–7.25 Hz across days with PSD up to first recovery sleep and then returned to baseline.SWS and summed power density in a broad low-frequency band respond to repeated partial sleep deprivation in a dose-response fashion during the first 4 h sleep, apparently reflecting a robust and stable homeostatic response to sleep loss.},

  abstract = {Insomnia disorder (ID) is a heterogeneous disorder with proposed subtypes based on objective sleep duration. We speculated that insomnia subtyping with additional power spectral analysis and measurement of response to acute sleep restriction may be informative in overall assessment of ID. To explore alternative classifications of ID subtypes, insomnia patients (n\,=\,99) underwent two consecutive overnight sleep studies: (i) habitual sleep opportunity (polysomnography, PSG) and, (ii) two hours less sleep opportunity (electroencephalography, EEG), with the first night compared to healthy controls (n\,=\,25). ID subtypes were derived from data-driven classification of PSG, EEG spectral power and interhemispheric EEG asymmetry index. Three insomnia subtypes with different sleep duration and NREM spectral power were identified. One subtype (n\,=\,26) had shorter sleep duration and lower NREM delta power than healthy controls (short-sleep delta-deficient; SSDD), the second subtype (n\,=\,51) had normal sleep duration but lower NREM delta power than healthy controls (normal-sleep delta-deficient; NSDD) and a third subtype showed (n\,=\,22) no difference in sleep duration or delta power from healthy controls (normal neurophysiological sleep; NNS). Acute sleep restriction improved multiple objective sleep measures across all insomnia subtypes including increased delta power in SSDD and NSDD, and improvements in subjective sleep quality for SSDD (p\,=\,0.03), with a trend observed for NSDD (p\,=\,0.057). These exploratory results suggest evidence of novel neurophysiological insomnia subtypes that may inform sleep state misperception in ID and with further research, may provide pathways for personalised care.},

  abstract = {Until recently, the association of chronic insomnia with significant medical morbidity was not established and its diagnosis was based solely on subjective complaints. We present evidence that insomnia with objective short sleep duration is the most biologically severe phenotype of the disorder, as it is associated with cognitive-emotional and cortical arousal, activation of both limbs of the stress system, and a higher risk for hypertension, impaired heart rate variability, diabetes, neurocognitive impairment, and mortality. Also, it appears that objective short sleep duration is a biological marker of genetic predisposition to chronic insomnia. In contrast, insomnia with objective normal sleep duration is associated with cognitive-emotional and cortical arousal and sleep misperception but not with signs of activation of both limbs of the stress system or medical complications. Furthermore, the first phenotype is associated with unremitting course, whereas the latter is more likely to remit. We propose that short sleep duration in insomnia is a reliable marker of the biological severity and medical impact of the disorder. Objective measures of sleep obtained in the home environment of the patient would become part of the routine assessment of insomnia patients in a clinician's office setting. We speculate that insomnia with objective short sleep duration has primarily biological roots and may respond better to biological treatments, whereas insomnia with objective normal sleep duration has primarily psychological roots and may respond better to psychological interventions alone.},

  abstract = {Since their discovery, slow oscillations have been observed to group spindles during non-REM sleep. Previous studies assert that the slow-oscillation downstate (DS) is preceded by slow spindles (10–12 Hz) and followed by fast spindles (12–16 Hz). Here, using both direct transcortical recordings in patients with intractable epilepsy (n = 10, 8 female), as well as scalp EEG recordings from a healthy cohort (n = 3, 1 female), we find in multiple cortical areas that both slow and fast spindles follow the DS. Although discrete oscillations do precede DSs, they are theta bursts (TBs) centered at 5–8 Hz. TBs were more pronounced for DSs in NREM stage 2 (N2) sleep compared with N3. TB with similar properties occur in the thalamus, but unlike spindles they have no clear temporal relationship with cortical TB. These differences in corticothalamic dynamics, as well as differences between spindles and theta in coupling high-frequency content, are consistent with NREM theta having separate generative mechanisms from spindles. The final inhibitory cycle of the TB coincides with the DS peak, suggesting that in N2, TB may help trigger the DS. Since the transition to N1 is marked by the appearance of theta, and the transition to N2 by the appearance of DS and thus spindles, a role of TB in triggering DS could help explain the sequence of electrophysiological events characterizing sleep. Finally, the coordinated appearance of spindles and DSs are implicated in memory consolidation processes, and the current findings redefine their temporal coupling with theta during NREM sleep. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Sleep is characterized by large slow waves which modulate brain activity. Prominent among these are downstates (DSs), periods of a few tenths of a second when most cells stop firing, and spindles, oscillations at ∼12 times a second lasting for ∼a second. In this study, we provide the first detailed description of another kind of sleep wave: theta bursts (TBs), a brief oscillation at ∼six cycles per second. We show, recording during natural sleep directly from the human cortex and thalamus, as well as on the scalp, that TBs precede, and spindles follow DSs. TBs may help trigger DSs in some circumstances, and could organize cortical and thalamic activity so that memories can be consolidated during sleep.},

  abstract = {It is well recognized that sleep time misperceptions are common among insomniacs, but little is known about the distribution and clinical significance of these subjective distortions. The current investigation was conducted to examine the distribution of sleep time misperceptions among a large (n =173), diverse group of insomniacs and to determine if such misperceptions might relate to the patients' clinical characteristics. Consistent with previous studies, our subjects, as a group, produced sleep estimates that were significantly (p \&lt; 0.0001) lower than poly-somnographically determined sleep times. However, patients' sleep time perceptions were widely distributed across a broad continuum, which ranged between gross underestimates and remarkable overestimates of actual sleep times. Results also showed that subgroups, formed on the basis of presenting complaints and diagnostic criteria (i.e. International Classification of Sleep Disorders nosology), differed in regard to the magnitude and direction of their sleep distortions. Moreover, these differences appeared consistent with the types of objective sleep disturbances these subgroups commonly experience. Hence, the tendency to underestimate actual sleep time is not a generic attribute of all insomniacs. Furthermore, it appears that the accuracy and nature of sleep time perceptions may relate to the type of sleep pathology underlying insomniacs' presenting complaints.},

These slow-wave complexes alternate with brief episodes of fast oscillations, similar to the sustained fast oscillations that occur during the wake state. We propose that alternating fast and slow waves consolidate information acquired previously during wakefulness. Slow-wave sleep would thus begin with spindle oscillations that open molecular gates to plasticity, then proceed by iteratively ‘recalling’ and ‘storing’ information primed in neural assemblies. This scenario provides a biophysical mechanism consistent with the growing evidence that sleep serves to consolidate memories.},

In agreement with a recent hypothesis, in the first of 3 companion papers, large-scale computer simulations of the sleeping thalamocortical system showed that a decrease in cortical synaptic strength is sufficient to account for the decline in SWA. In the model, the reduction in SWA was accompanied by decreased incidence of high-amplitude slow waves, decreased wave slopes, and increased number of waves with multiple peaks. In a second companion paper in the rat, local field potential recordings during early and late sleep confirmed the predictions of the model.4 Here, we investigated the model's predictions in humans by using all-night high-density (hd)-EEG recordings to explore slow-wave parameters over the entire cortical mantle.256-channel EEG recordings in humans over the course of an entire night's sleep.Sound-attenuated sleep research roomSeven healthy male subjectsN/A.During late sleep (non-rapid eye movement [NREM] episodes 3 and 4, toward morning), when compared with early sleep (NREM sleep episodes 1 and 2, at the beginning of the night), the analysis revealed (1) reduced SWA, (2) fewer large-amplitude slow waves, (3) decreased wave slopes, (4) more frequent multipeak waves. The decrease in slope between early and late sleep was present even when waves were directly matched by wave amplitude and slow-wave power in the background EEG. Finally, hd-EEG showed that multipeak waves have multiple cortical origins.In the human EEG, the decline of SWA during sleep is accompanied by changes in slow-wave parameters that were predicted by a computer model simulating a homeostatic reduction of cortical synaptic strength.},

The results indicated that both accumulated sleep loss, circadian and ultradian (2 cycles/day) factors were significant in determining subjective estimates of sleepiness. The extent of the differences between subjective sleepiness ratings before cognitive testing and after testing was dependent upon the phase of the circadian cycle. These differences were greatest at approximately 0200—0600 hours and least around 1000 hours. A second low point occurred at 1800-2000 hours. Analysis by complex demodulation of the individual subjects' sleepiness rating curves indicated that the amount of variance accounted for by the circadian component increased significantly after cognitive testing.},

  abstract = {So-called ‘sleep misperception’ refers to a phenomenon in which individuals have the impression of sleeping little or not at all despite normal objective measures of sleep. It is unknown whether this subjective–objective mismatch truly reflects an abnormal perception of sleep, or whether it results from the inability of standard sleep recording techniques to capture ‘wake-like’ brain activity patterns that could account for feeling awake during sleep. Here, we systematically reviewed studies reporting sleep macro- and microstructural, metabolic, and mental correlates of sleep (mis)perception. Our findings suggest that most individuals tend to accurately estimate their sleep duration measured with polysomnography (PSG). In good sleepers, feeling awake during sleep is the rule at sleep onset, remains frequent in the first non-rapid eye movement sleep cycle and almost never occurs in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In contrast, there are patients with insomnia who consistently underestimate their sleep duration, regardless of how long they sleep. Unlike good sleepers, they continue to feel awake after the first sleep cycle and importantly, during REM sleep. Their mental activity during sleep is also more thought-like. Initial studies based on standard PSG parameters largely failed to show consistent differences in sleep macrostructure between these patients and controls. However, recent studies assessing sleep with more refined techniques have revealed that these patients show metabolic and microstructural electroencephalography changes that likely reflect a shift towards greater cortical activation during sleep and correlate with feeling awake. We discuss the significance of these correlates and conclude with open questions and possible ways to address them.},

  abstract = {The diagnosis and management of insomnia relies primarily on clinical history. However, patient self-report of sleep–wake times may not agree with objective measurements. We hypothesized that those with shallow or fragmented sleep would under-report sleep quantity, and that this might account for some of the mismatch. We compared objective and subjective sleep–wake times for 277 patients who underwent diagnostic polysomnography. The group included those with insomnia symptoms (n = 92), obstructive sleep apnea (n = 66) or both (n = 119). Mismatch of wake duration was context dependent: all three groups overestimated sleep latency but underestimated wakefulness after sleep onset. The insomnia group underestimated total sleep time by a median of 81 min. However, contrary to our hypothesis, measures of fragmentation (N1, arousal index, sleep efficiency, etc.) did not correlate with the subjective sleep duration estimates. To unmask a potential relationship between sleep architecture and subjective duration, we tested three hypotheses: N1 is perceived as wake; sleep bouts under 10 min are perceived as wake; or N1 and N2 are perceived in a weighted fashion. None of these hypotheses exposed a match between subjective and objective sleep duration. We show only modest performance of a Naïve Bayes Classifier algorithm for predicting mismatch using clinical and polysomnographic variables. Subjective–objective mismatch is common in patients reporting insomnia symptoms. We conclude that mismatch was not attributable to commonly measured polysomnographic measures of fragmentation. Further insight is needed into the complex relationships between subjective perception of sleep and conventional, objective measurements.},

The role of sleep is to downscale synaptic strength to a baseline level that is energetically sustainable, makes efficient use of gray matter space, and is beneficial for learning and memory. Thus, sleep is the price we have to pay for plasticity, and its goal is the homeostatic regulation of the total synaptic weight impinging on neurons. The hypothesis accounts for a large number of experimental facts, makes several specific predictions, and has implications for both sleep and mood disorders.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between overnight sleep perception and the daytime multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) among individuals who were primary insomnia patients (PIPs) or good sleeper controls (GSCs). We collected overnight sleep data via polysomnography (PSG), subjective sleep data via a morning questionnaire (self-evaluated) and MSLT data via four 20-min naps over 8 h. Subjects included 122 PIPs and 48 GSCs. Sleep perception was calculated as subjective sleep time/objective sleep time × 100\%. PIPs showed a significant difference (P {$<$} 0.001) between sleep time, as determined by PSG (387.8 ± 100 min) and self-report (226.3 ± 160 min), but no difference was obtained for GSCs (440.6 ± 53 versus 435.4 ± 65 min). The means for sleep perception were 56.4 ± 38.8\% for the PIPs and 99.3 ± 13.6\% for the GSCs (P {$<$} 0.001). In the PIPs group, weak but statistically significant negative correlations (r: −0.20 to −0.25) were found for MSLT versus sleep perception and versus self- and PSG-evaluated sleep time. Compared to PIPs with low scores on the MSLT, those with high scores had less sleep perception (\%), less self- and PSG-evaluated sleep time and greater sleep misperception time. GSCs did not show significant correlations between MSLT and sleep measures or differences in comparisons between individuals with high and low scores on the MSLT. These results add novel data to the literature by suggesting that 24-h hyperarousal potentially plays a key role in the pathophysiological issues of insomnia.},

  abstract = {Despite being used commonly in sleep medicine, the term “sleep quality” has not been rigorously defined. The purpose of this article is to consider objective measures of the subjective “sleep quality” experience. In order to do so, it was necessary to choose a definition of “sleep quality” as a basis for discussion. We have chosen to employ the simple Likert-style rating of (the previous night's) sleep quality, commonly included as an item on sleep diaries, as the core sleep quality indicator and focus of this article. The potential objective measures discussed include polysomnography, cyclic alternating pattern and actigraphy. We review the strengths and weaknesses of these measures as well as discuss challenges facing the development of an objective correlate of “sleep quality” ratings, including that such ratings may reflect non-sleep phenomena such as mood or health status and the possibility that “sleep quality” may reflect different aspects of sleep among people. We also discuss new approaches intended to address these challenges, including: (1) combining different types of measures; (2) sub-grouping individuals based on clinical or physiological characteristics and developing different measures in these subgroups; and (3) sub-grouping based on the association of potential measures and quality ratings over nights.},

We included all reviews and systematic reviews related to sleepiness assessment tools published up to March 2021. Three investigators independently assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion and identified 36 relevant reviews. In total, 99 tools were identified and classified into 8 categories. We classified them depending on their category, their publication year and the number of mentions in the 36 included reviews. The 6 most frequently cited were the Epworth sleepiness scale, the multiple sleep latency test, the maintenance of wakefulness test, the Stanford sleepiness scale, the Karolinska sleepiness scale, and the psychomotor vigilance task. Despite the limitation that we may have missed some recently developed tools, this historical perspective on sleepiness measurement is a first step toward a better delineation of the different dimensions underlying the constructs of sleepiness, and will serve as a basis for further discussion in the clinical and research sleep community.},

  abstract = {Objective Non-restorative sleep (NRS) is a core symptom of insomnia, typically defined as a subjective feeling of being unrefreshed upon awakening. NRS symptoms have been less consistently studied than other symptoms of insomnia, and there is no consensus regarding measurement of NRS. Given its subjective nature, patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments are important for evaluating NRS symptom severity and treatment-related changes. The objective of this literature review was to identify PROs used in insomnia populations that purport to measure NRS, and to evaluate their psychometric characteristics. Methods A comprehensive review of PRO instruments used in insomnia was conducted; instruments were reviewed for NRS content by two independent reviewers; a total of 26 instruments identified to contain NRS content were retained for further review. Results Of the 26 instruments reviewed, 23 contained at least one item evaluating subjective nighttime aspects of NRS; 17 contained at least one item evaluating daytime aspects of NRS. Only the Sleep Assessment Questionnaire contained a specific NRS domain score. However, little published evidence was available regarding measurement properties of the NRS domain in insomnia populations. Conclusions There is currently no reliable and well-validated PRO instrument available for specifically evaluating NRS symptom severity and response to interventions in insomnia populations. Reliable and valid measurement tools are needed to measure the symptom of NRS in insomnia.},

This frequency-specific frontal predominance was already present in the first 30 min of recovery sleep, and dissipated in the course of the 8-h sleep episode.

This investigation utilized high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) to examine topographic changes in slow waves during repeated partial sleep deprivation. Methods Twenty-four participants underwent a 6-day sleep restriction protocol. Spectral and period-amplitude analyses of sleep hdEEG data were used to examine changes in slow wave energy, count, amplitude, and slope relative to baseline. Results Changes in slow wave energy were dependent on the quantity of NREM sleep utilized for analysis, with widespread increases during sleep restriction and recovery when comparing data from the first portion of the sleep period, but restricted to recovery sleep if the entire sleep episode was considered. Period-amplitude analysis was less dependent on the quantity of NREM sleep utilized, and demonstrated topographic changes in the count, amplitude, and distribution of slow waves, with frontal increases in slow wave amplitude, numbers of high-amplitude waves, and amplitude/slopes of low amplitude waves resulting from partial sleep deprivation. Conclusions Topographic changes in slow waves occur across the course of partial sleep restriction and recovery.

  abstract = {In the last three decades the two-process model of sleep regulation has served as a major conceptual framework in sleep research. It has been applied widely in studies on fatigue and performance and to dissect individual differences in sleep regulation. The model posits that a homeostatic process (Process S) interacts with a process controlled by the circadian pacemaker (Process C), with time-courses derived from physiological and behavioural variables. The model simulates successfully the timing and intensity of sleep in diverse experimental protocols. Electrophysiological recordings from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) suggest that S and C interact continuously. Oscillators outside the SCN that are linked to energy metabolism are evident in SCN-lesioned arrhythmic animals subjected to restricted feeding or methamphetamine administration, as well as in human subjects during internal desynchronization. In intact animals these peripheral oscillators may dissociate from the central pacemaker rhythm. A sleep/fast and wake/feed phase segregate antagonistic anabolic and catabolic metabolic processes in peripheral tissues. A deficiency of Process S was proposed to account for both depressive sleep disturbances and the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation. The model supported the development of novel non-pharmacological treatment paradigms in psychiatry, based on manipulating circadian phase, sleep and light exposure. In conclusion, the model remains conceptually useful for promoting the integration of sleep and circadian rhythm research. Sleep appears to have not only a short-term, use-dependent function; it also serves to enforce rest and fasting, thereby supporting the optimization of metabolic processes at the appropriate phase of the 24-h cycle.},

In addition, there was a significant association between NIS and cardiovascular disease, whereas NRS was associated with other primary sleep disorders (including habitual snoring, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome), respiratory diseases (emphysema and chronic bronchitis), thyroid disease, and cancer as well as increased CRP levels. In addition, the study participants with NRS only reported poorer scores on the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) than those without insomnia symptoms or those with NIS only.These findings suggest that there are substantial differences between NIS and NRS in terms of sociodemographic factors, comorbidity with other sleep and physical disorders, increased CRP level, and functional impairment. An inflammatory response might play a unique role in the pathogenesis of NRS.},

Methods A total of 2291 middle-aged adults (mean [SD]=46.3 [5.1] years old, 50.0\% males at follow-up) were recruited into a 5-year follow-up study. NRS was defined as morning unfreshness after getting up ⩾3times/week over the past 12months. Socio-demographics, other concurrent sleep complaints, and daytime symptoms were measured at baseline. Chronic medical problems in the past one year were additionally assessed at follow up. Results Several sleep problems (including other insomnia subtypes, snoring, and nightmares) and daytime symptoms were strongly associated with NRS at baseline. NRS had considerable persistence (31.9\%), partial remission (22.7\%), and incidence rate (5.2\%). New incidence of NRS was predicted by female gender (AOR=1.67), preferring not to get up in the morning (AOR=1.96), fatigue (AOR=2.18), and short sleep duration (AOR=1.87), whereas persistence of NRS was predicted by difficulty initiating sleep (AOR=2.36). In the fully adjusted models, baseline NRS was significantly associated with multiple medical disorders at follow-up, including frequent allergic rhinitis (AOR=1.62) and laryngopharyngitis (AOR=2.47), diabetes mellitus (AOR=2.63), gastroesophageal reflux disease (AOR=2.03), eye problems (AOR=2.45), eczema (AOR=2.18), and poor mental health (AOR=1.68). Conclusions The persistent course and independent association of NRS with adverse medical and mental outcomes argue for a distinct nosological status and the need for rigorous medical attention.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have reported surprisingly few consistent insomnia-characteristics with respect to cognitions, mood, traits, history of life events and family history. One interpretation of this limited consistency is that different subtypes of insomnia exist, each with its own specific multivariate profile of characteristics. Because previously unrecognized subtypes will be differentially represented in individual studies and dilute effect sizes of subtype-dependent characteristics of importance, they are unlikely to be reported consistently in individual studies, let~alone in meta-analyses. This review therefore aims to complement meta-analyses by listing previously reported psychometric characteristics of insomnia, irrespective of the degree of consistency over studies. The review clearly indicates that characteristics of insomnia may not be limited to sleep. Reports suggest that at least some individuals with insomnia may deviate from people without sleep complaints with respect to demographics, mental and physical health, childhood trauma, life events, fatigue, sleepiness, hyperarousal, hyperactivity, other sleep disorders, lifetime sleep history, chronotype, depression, anxiety, mood, quality of life, personality, happiness, worry, rumination, self-consciousness, sensitivity, dysfunctional beliefs, self-conscious emotion regulation, coping, nocturnal mentation, wake resting-state mentation, physical activity, food intake, temperature perception and hedonic evaluation. The value of this list of characteristics is that 1) internet has now made it feasible to asses them all in a large sample of people suffering from insomnia, and 2) statistical methods like latent class analysis and community detection can utilize them for a truly bottom–up data-driven search for subtypes. The supplement to this review provides a blueprint of this multivariate approach as implemented in the Sleep registry platform (www.sleepregistry.nl), that allows for bottom–up subtyping and fosters cross-cultural comparison and worldwide collaboration on insomnia subtype finding – and beyond.},

Their regional distribution and amplitude is affected by brain maturation and by time spent awake, mediated in part by experience-dependent changes in synaptic strength. Recent studies have shown that local low-frequency oscillations ({$<$}10Hz) can also occur in REM sleep and during wakefulness, leading to region-specific cognitive errors. Local decreases and increases of slow wave activity in posterior brain regions have been linked to the occurrence of dreaming and to unconscious sleep, respectively. Finally, the coexistence of local sleep-like and wake-like patterns in different brain areas is characteristic of several sleep disorders and may offer insights into these conditions.},

  abstract = {Objectives To investigate the association of insomnia and chronotype preference with daytime impairment and psychopathology in a community sample of adolescents in Hong Kong. Methods This was a cross-sectional study that included seven local secondary schools in Hong Kong. A total of 1667 adolescents (mean age: 14.8~±~1.6 years old; boys: 56.5\%) returned a battery of self-report questionnaires including Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and reduced Horne and Östberg Morningness and Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ) for assessing insomnia symptoms and chronotype preference, respectively. A subset of adolescent samples (n~=~768) were additionally assessed for suicidal ideation. Potential confounders including age, gender and sleep duration were controlled for in the analyses. Results The prevalence of insomnia symptoms and eveningness chronotype was 37\% and 25.6\%, respectively. Regression models indicated that insomnia and eveningness were independently associated with excessive daytime sleepiness (insomnia: adjusted OR [AdjOR]~=~3.8; 95\% confidence interval [C.I.]~=~2.9–5.0; eveningness: AdjOR~=~2.6; 95\% C.I.~=~1.9–3.7), and an increased risk of depression (insomnia: AdjOR~=~3.5, 95\% C.I.~=~2.5–5.0; eveningness: AdjOR~=~2.0, 95\% C.I.~=~1.3–3.2). The odds ratio increased to 8.7 (95\% C.I.~=~6.1–12.3, p~{$<~$}0.001) for excessive daytime sleepiness and 4.8 (95\% C.I.~=~3.2–7.2, p~{$<~$}0.001) for depression among adolescents with both insomnia and eveningness. Insomnia symptoms, but not eveningness, were associated with anxiety symptoms (AdjOR~=~5.8; 95\% C.I.~=~3.6–9.4) and suicidal ideation (AdjOR~=~2.1, 95\% C.I.~=~1.4–3.2). Conclusions The present study provided further evidence that insomnia and eveningness uniquely contributed to poor daytime functioning and mood related outcomes, while the co-existence of these two conditions could confer a greater risk in adolescents. However, insomnia, but not eveningness, was significantly linked to suicidality after controlling for mood symptoms. Our findings highlighted the necessity of timely management of sleep and circadian issues in adolescents.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Sleep is a physiological state that plays important role in the recovery of fatigue. However, the relationship between the physiological status of sleep and subjective fatigue remains unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized that the non-recovery of fatigue at wake time due to non-restorative sleep might be ascribed to changes in specific parameters of electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate variability (HRV) in poor sleepers. Twenty healthy female shift-working nurses participated in the study. Subjective fatigue was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) at bedtime and wake time. During sleep on the night between 2 consecutive day shifts, the EEG powers at the frontal pole, HRV based on electrocardiograms, and distal-proximal gradient of skin temperature were recorded and analyzed. The results indicated that the subjects with high fatigue on the VAS at wake time exhibited (1) a decrease in deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) (stageN3) sleep duration in the first sleep cycle; (2) a decrease in REM latency; (3) a decrease in ultra-slow and delta EEG powers, particularly from 30 to 65 min after sleep onset; (4) a decrease in the total power of HRV, particularly from 0 to 30 min after sleep onset; (5) an increase in the very low frequency component of HRV; and (6) a smaller increase in the distal-proximal gradient of skin temperature, than those of the subjects with low fatigue levels. The correlational and structural equation modeling analyses of these parameters suggested that an initial decrease in the total power of HRV from 0 to 30 min after sleep onset might inhibit the recovery from fatigue during sleep (i.e., increase the VAS score at wake time) via its effects on the ultra-slow and delta powers from 30 to 65 min after sleep onset, stageN3 duration in the first sleep cycle, REM latency, and distal-proximal gradient of skin temperature. These findings suggest an important role of these physiological factors in recovery from fatigue during sleep, and that interventions to modify these physiological factors might ameliorate fatigue at wake time.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Methods Population-based epidemiological survey respondents (n = 2011) completed the Brief Insomnia Questionnaire (BIQ), a validated scale generating DSM-IV, DSM-5, ICD-10, and ICSD-2 insomnia disorder. Results The weighted prevalence of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking up too early, and non-restorative sleep that occurred ≥3 days per week was 14.0\%, 28.3\%, 32.1\%, and 39.9\%, respectively. When quantitative criteria were included, the prevalence dropped the most from 39.9\% to 8.4\% for non-restorative sleep, and the least from 14.0\% to 12.9\% for difficulty falling asleep. The weighted prevalence of DSM-IV, ICD-10, ICSD-2, and any of the three insomnia disorders was 22.1\%, 4.7\%, 15.1\%, and 22.1\%, respectively; for DSM-5 insomnia disorder, it was 10.8\%. Conclusion Compared with 22.1\%, 3.9\%, and 14.7\% for DSM-IV, ICD-10, and ICSD-2 in the AIS, cross-cultural difference in the prevalence of insomnia disorder is less than what is expected. The prevalence is reduced by half from DSM-IV to DSM-5. ICD-10 insomnia disorder has the lowest prevalence, perhaps because excessive concern and preoccupation, one of its diagnostic criteria, is not always present in people with insomnia.},

It tells us that consciousness can be lost but also that it can be regained, in all its richness, when we are disconnected from the environment and unable to reflect. By considering the neurophysiological differences between dreaming and dreamless sleep, we can learn about the substrate of consciousness and understand why it vanishes. We also learn that the ongoing state of the substrate of consciousness determines the way each experience feels regardless of how it is triggered—endogenously or exogenously. Dreaming consciousness is also a window on sleep and its functions. Dreams tell us that the sleeping brain is remarkably lively, recombining intrinsic activation patterns from a vast repertoire, freed from the requirements of ongoing behavior and cognitive control.},

To promote standardization of the PVT and increase its sensitivity and specificity to sleep loss, we determined PVT metrics and task durations that optimally discriminated sleep deprived subjects from alert subjects.Repeated-measures experiments involving 10-min PVT assessments every 2 h across both acute total sleep deprivation (TSD) and 5 days of chronic partial sleep deprivation (PSD).Controlled laboratory environment.74 healthy subjects (34 female), aged 22–45 years.TSD experiment involving 33 h awake (N = 31 subjects) and a PSD experiment involving 5 nights of 4 h time in bed (N = 43 subjects).In a paired t-test paradigm and for both TSD and PSD, effect sizes of 10 different PVT performance outcomes were calculated. Effect sizes were high for both TSD (1.59–1.94) and PSD (0.88–1.21) for PVT metrics related to lapses and to measures of psychomotor speed, i.e., mean 1/RT (response time) and mean slowest 10\% 1/RT. In contrast, PVT mean and median RT outcomes scored low to moderate effect sizes influenced by extreme values. Analyses facilitating only portions of the full 10-min PVT indicated that for some outcomes, high effect sizes could be achieved with PVT durations considerably shorter than 10 min, although metrics involving lapses seemed to profit from longer test durations in TSD.Due to their superior conceptual and statistical properties and high sensitivity to sleep deprivation, metrics involving response speed and lapses should be considered primary outcomes for the 10-min PVT. In contrast, PVT mean and median metrics, which are among the most widely used outcomes, should be avoided as primary measures of alertness. Our analyses also suggest that some shorter-duration PVT versions may be sensitive to sleep loss, depending on the outcome variable selected, although this will need to be confirmed in comparative analyses of separate duration versions of the PVT. Using both sensitive PVT metrics and optimal test durations maximizes the sensitivity of the PVT to sleep loss and therefore potentially decreases the sample size needed to detect the same neurobehavioral deficit. We propose criteria to better standardize the 10-min PVT and facilitate between-study comparisons and meta-analyses.},

To understand the neural mechanisms underlying attentional lapses, we studied the behaviour, subjective experience and neural activity of healthy participants performing a task. Random interruptions prompted participants to indicate their mental states as task-focused, mind-wandering or mind-blanking. Using high-density electroencephalography, we report here that spatially and temporally localized slow waves, a pattern of neural activity characteristic of the transition toward sleep, accompany behavioural markers of lapses and preceded reports of mind wandering and mind blanking. The location of slow waves could distinguish between sluggish and impulsive behaviours, and between mind wandering and mind blanking. Our results suggest attentional lapses share a common physiological origin: the emergence of local sleep-like activity within the awake brain.},

During sleep, neurons oscillate between ‘on’ periods, when they fire as in an awake brain, and ‘off’ periods, when they stop firing altogether and the EEG displays high-amplitude slow waves. However, what happens to neuronal firing after a long period of being awake is not known. Here we show that in freely behaving rats after a long period in an awake state, cortical neurons can go briefly ‘offline’ as in sleep, accompanied by slow waves in the local EEG. Neurons often go offline in one cortical area but not in another, and during these periods of ‘local sleep’, the incidence of which increases with the duration of the awake state, rats are active and display an ‘awake’ EEG. However, they are progressively impaired in a sugar pellet reaching task. Thus, although both the EEG and behaviour indicate wakefulness, local populations of neurons in the cortex may be falling asleep, with negative consequences for performance.},

During much of sleep, cortical neurons undergo slow oscillations in membrane potential, which appear in electroencephalograms as slow wave activity (SWA) of {$<$}4\,Hz1. The amount of SWA is homeostatically regulated, increasing after wakefulness and returning to baseline during sleep2. It has been suggested that SWA homeostasis may reflect synaptic changes underlying a cellular need for sleep3. If this were so, inducing local synaptic changes should induce local SWA changes, and these should benefit neural function. Here we show that sleep homeostasis indeed has a local component, which can be triggered by a learning task involving specific brain regions. Furthermore, we show that the local increase in SWA after learning correlates with improved performance of the task after sleep. Thus, sleep homeostasis can be induced on a local level and can benefit performance.},

While remaining conceptually useful, many sleep phenomena are difficult to explain using that paradigm, including, unilateral sleep, sleep-walking, and poor performance after sleep deprivation. Further, all animals sleep after non-lethal brain lesions, regardless of whether the lesion includes sleep regulatory circuits, suggesting that sleep is a fundamental property of small viable neuronal/glial networks. That small areas of the brain can exhibit non-rapid eye movement sleep-like states is summarized. Further, sleep-like states in neuronal/glial cultures are described. The local sleep states, whether in~vivo or in~vitro, share electrophysiological properties and molecular regulatory components with whole animal sleep and exhibit sleep homeostasis. The molecular regulatory components of sleep are also involved in plasticity and inflammation. Like sleep, these processes, are initiated by local cell-activity dependent events, yet have at higher levels of tissue organization whole body functions. While there are large literatures dealing with local initiation and regulation of plasticity and inflammation, the literature surrounding local sleep is in its infancy and clinical applications of the local sleep concept are absent. Regardless, the local use-dependent sleep paradigm can advise and advance future research and clinical applications.},

A global increase in wake theta activity (5-9 Hz) also occurs. Recently, it was shown that prolonged wakefulness in rodents leads to signs of “local sleep” in an otherwise awake brain, accompanied by a slow/theta wave (2-6 Hz) in the local EEG that occurs at different times in different cortical areas. Compelling evidence in animals and humans also indicates that sleep is locally regulated by the amount of experience-dependent plasticity. Here, we asked whether the extended practice of tasks that involve specific brain circuits results in increased occurrence of local intermittent theta waves in the human EEG, above and beyond the global EEG changes previously described.Participants recorded with high-density EEG completed 2 experiments during which they stayed awake ≥ 24 h practicing a language task (audiobook listening [AB]) or a visuomotor task (driving simulator [DS]).Sleep laboratory.16 healthy participants (7 females).Two extended wake periods.Both conditions resulted in global increases in resting wake EEG theta power at the end of 24 h of wake, accompanied by increased sleepiness. Moreover, wake theta power as well as the occurrence and amplitude of theta waves showed regional, task-dependent changes, increasing more over left frontal derivations in AB, and over posterior parietal regions in DS. These local changes in wake theta power correlated with similar local changes in sleep low frequencies including SWA.Extended experience-dependent plasticity of specific circuits results in a local increase of the wake theta EEG power in those regions, followed by more intense sleep, as reflected by SWA, over the same areas.},

In awake rats, the occurrence of an OFF period in a brain area relevant for behavior results in performance errors. Here we investigated the potential relationship between local sleep events and negative behavioral outcomes in humans. Volunteers participated in two prolonged wakefulness experiments (24 h), each including 12 h of practice with either a driving simulation (DS) game or a battery of tasks based on executive functions (EFs). Multiple high-density EEG recordings were obtained during each experiment, both in quiet rest conditions and during execution of two behavioral tests, a response inhibition test and a motor test, aimed at assessing changes in impulse control and visuomotor performance, respectively. In addition, fMRI examinations obtained at 12 h intervals were used to investigate changes in inter-regional connectivity. The EF experiment was associated with a reduced efficiency in impulse control, whereas DS led to a relative impairment in visuomotor control. A specific spatial and temporal correlation was observed between EEG theta waves occurring in task-related areas and deterioration of behavioral performance. The fMRI connectivity analysis indicated that performance impairment might partially depend on a breakdown in connectivity determined by a “network overload.” Present results demonstrate the existence of an association between theta waves during wakefulness and performance errors and may contribute explaining behavioral impairments under conditions of sleep deprivation/restriction.},

  abstract = {A considerable number of hypothetical functions of sleep have been proposed, but none of the hypotheses under active consideration has gained enough experimental support to convince a preponderance of sleep researchers. Some researchers even question whether we should expect to identify one primary function of sleep, given the multitude of physiological processes that are affected by sleep. But we do know that sleep is homeostatically regulated, and we have discovered a great deal about the physiological mechanisms underlying sleep homeostasis. Other homeostatically regulated behaviors have one or a small number of functions, and those functions are closely linked to the homeostatic control mechanisms for those process. We can therefore apply what is already known about sleep homeostasis to test and evaluate hypothesized functions of sleep. It should be possible to trace the connections between the cellular and molecular basis of a hypothesized function and the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying homeostatic responses to sleep deprivation. Hypothesized functions that do not plausibly admit of such connections can reasonably be rejected. Four current hypotheses suggesting that the function of sleep is to assist in the process of activity-dependent synaptic reorganization are critiqued to demonstrate how what is known about sleep homeostasis can be used to assess hypothesized functions of sleep.},

  abstract = {All currents in the brain superimpose to yield an 'electric field' at any given point in space. The current sources and sinks form dipoles or higher-order n-poles.Extracellular currents arise from many sources, including synaptic currents, fast action potentials and their afterpotentials, calcium spikes and voltage-dependent intrinsic currents.The magnitude of extracellular currents depends critically on two factors: the cytoarchitectural organization of a network and the temporal synchrony of the various current sinks and sources.Depending on the recording method, neuroscientists distinguish between electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocorticogram (ECoG) and local field potential (LFP; also known as micro-, depth or intracranial EEG), although all of these measures refer to the same biophysical process.The electric field is the force 'felt' by an electric charge, and can be transmitted through brain volume. The extent of volume conduction depends on the relationships between the current dipole and the features of the conductive medium.High-density sampling of the extracellular field with contemporary methods enables the calculation of current source density, and therefore the localization of current sinks and sources.The voltage gradients generated by highly synchronous activity of neuronal groups can affect the transmembrane potential of the member neurons and alter their excitability through ephaptic coupling.Synchronous spiking of nearby neurons is the main source of the high-frequency components of the local field.There is a discernable relationship between the temporal evolution of cell assemblies and the time-dependent changes of the spatially distributed currents. High-density, wide-band recordings of the local field can therefore provide access to both afferent inputs and the spiking output of neurons.},

  abstract = {Several recent results show that sleep and sleep regulation are not only global phenomena encompassing the entire brain, but have local features. It is well established that slow-wave activity [SWA; mean electroencephalographic (EEG) power density in the 0.75–4.0 Hz band] in non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is a function of the prior history of sleep and wakefulness. SWA is thought to reflect the homeostatic component of the two-process model of sleep regulation. According to this model, originally formulated for the rat and later extended to human sleep, the timing and structure of sleep are determined by the interaction of a homeostatic Process S and a circadian process. Our aim was to investigate the dynamics of SWA in the EEG of two brain regions (frontal and occipital cortex) after sleep deprivation (SD) in two of the mice strains most often used in gene targeting. C57BL/6J (n = 9) and 129/Ola (n = 8) were recorded during a 24-h baseline day, 6-h SD, and 18-h recovery. Both derivations showed a significant increase in SWA in NREM sleep after SD in both strains. In the first hour of recovery, SWA was enhanced more in the frontal derivation than in the occipital derivation and showed a faster decline. This difference resulted in a lower value for the time constant for the decrease of SWA in the frontal derivation (frontal: 10.9 ± 2.1 and 6.8 ± 0.9 h in Ola and C57, respectively; occipital: 16.6 ± 2.1 and 14.1 ± 1.5 h; P {$<$} 0.02; for each of the strains; paired t-test). Neither time constant differed significantly between the strains. The subdivision of SWA into a slower and faster band (0.75–2.5 Hz and 2.75–4.0 Hz) further highlighted regional differences in the effect of SD. The lower frequency band had a higher initial value in the frontal derivation than in the occipital derivation in both strains. Moreover, in the higher frequency band a prominent reversal took place so that power in the frontal derivation fell below the occipital values in both strains. Thus our results indicate that there may be differences in the brain in the effects of SD on SWA in mice, suggesting regional differences in the dynamics of the homeostatic component of sleep regulation. The data support the hypothesis that sleep has local, use- or waking-dependent features that are reflected in the EEG, as has been shown for humans and the laboratory rat.},

To date, most of the empirical work has focused on the issue of hyperarousal and very little work has been undertaken on the issue of sleep homeostasis. In the present paper, we review the five lines of evidence which may be used to support the proposition that sleep homeostasis is altered in Primary Insomnia. These include findings pertaining to Slow Wave Sleep density, level of daytime sleepiness, sleepiness following sleep deprivation, recovery sleep following sleep deprivation, and response to sleep restriction therapy. In addition, we provide a discussion regarding how hyperarousal and circadian factors may interact with altered sleep homeostasis, and suggestions for further inquiry.},

It is hypothesized that sleep serves to stabilize these competitive processes by providing a pattern of stimulation that serves to maintain a synaptic infrastructure upon which wakefulness-driven synaptic changes are superimposed. Sleep is ‘quantal’ in nature in that sleep is a statistical property of a population of neuronal groups in different states. The theory unifies past theories of sleep function yet simultaneously provides a fundamental new paradigm for sleep research.},

For some memories, further consolidation requires sleep, but whether plastic processes during wakefulness and sleep differ is unclear. We show that, in rat cortex and hippocampus, GluR1-containing AMPA receptor (AMPAR) levels are high during wakefulness and low during sleep, and changes in the phosphorylation states of AMPARs, CamKII and GSK3β are consistent with synaptic potentiation during wakefulness and depression during sleep. Furthermore, slope and amplitude of cortical evoked responses increase after wakefulness, decrease after sleep and correlate with changes in slow-wave activity, a marker of sleep pressure. Changes in molecular and electrophysiological indicators of synaptic strength are largely independent of the time of day. Finally, cortical long-term potentiation can be easily induced after sleep, but not after wakefulness. Thus, wakefulness appears to be associated with net synaptic potentiation, whereas sleep may favor global synaptic depression, thereby preserving an overall balance of synaptic strength.},

The current review provides substantial support for the concept that hyperarousal processes from the molecular to the higher system level play a key role in the pathophysiology of primary insomnia. Autonomous, neuroendocrine, neuroimmunological, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies demonstrate increased levels of arousal in primary insomnia during both night and daytime. In the light of neurobiological theories of sleep–wake regulation, primary insomnia may be conceptualized as a final common pathway resulting from the interplay between a genetic vulnerability for an imbalance between arousing and sleep-inducing brain activity, psychosocial/medical stressors and perpetuating mechanisms including dysfunctional sleep-related behavior, learned sleep preventing associations and other cognitive factors like tendency to worry/ruminate.},

  abstract = {To determine whether the spectral characteristics of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) of insomniacs differ from that of healthy subjects, we compared in each of the first four non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) episodes: (a) the time courses of absolute power, averaged over the subjects in each group, for the delta, theta, alpha, sigma and beta frequency bands; (b) the relationship between these time courses; and (c) the overnight trend of integrated power in each frequency band. The results show that NREM power, for all frequencies below the beta range, has slower rise rates and reaches lower levels in the insomniac group, whereas beta power is significantly increased. In REM, insomniacs show lower levels in the delta and theta bands, whereas power in the faster frequency bands is significantly increased. Thus, the pathophysiology of insomnia is characterized not only by the generally acknowledged slow wave deficiency, but also by an excessive hyperarousal of the central nervous system throughout the night, affecting both REM and NREM sleep. This hyperarousal is interpreted in terms of the neuronal group theory of sleep which provides a possible explanation for the discrepancies observed between subjective impressions and objective measures of sleep. Also, it is suggested that the progressive hyperpolarization of the thalamocortical neurons as sleep deepens is slower in the patient population and that this may explain the observed slow wave deficiency. The homeostatic control of slow wave activity, on the other hand, would appear to be intact in the patient population.},

In this study, we evaluated 1) the extent to which high frequency EEG activity is limited to the 14-32 Hz domain, 2) whether high frequency EEG activity (HFA) is associated with discrepancies between subjective and PSG measures of sleep continuity, and 3) the extent to which high frequency EEG activity occurs in patients with primary, as opposed to secondary, insomnia. DESIGN: Three groups (n=9 per group) were compared: Primary Insomnia, Insomnia secondary to Major Depression, and Good Sleeper Controls. Groups were matched for age, sex and body mass. Average spectral profiles were created for each NREM cycle after removing waking and movement epochs and epochs containing micro- or mini-arousals. SETTING: Sleep Research Laboratory PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Patients with primary and secondary insomnia INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Subjects with Primary Insomnia exhibited more average NREM activity for Beta-1 (14-20Hz), Beta-2 (20-35Hz) and Gamma activity (35-45Hz) than the other two groups (p.{$<$}.01). Group differences were also suggestive for Omega activity (45.0-125Hz) (p.{$<$}.10), with MDD subjects tending to exhibit more activity than the other groups. Correlational analyses revealed that average NREM Beta-1 and Beta-2 activity tended to be negatively correlated with subjective-objective discrepancy measures for total sleep time and sleep latency. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that Beta activity is increased in Primary Insomnia. In addition, our data suggest that high frequency activity in patients with Primary Insomnia is limited to the Beta/Gamma range (14-45 Hz), and is negatively associated with the perception of sleep.},

Evidence regarding sleep depth marked by slow-wave activity ({$<$} 4 Hz) is more mixed. Distinguishing subcomponents of slow-wave activity (slow-oscillation [{$<$} 1 Hz] or delta activity [1–4 Hz)]) may be critical in understanding these discrepancies, given that these oscillations have different neural generators and are functionally distinct. Here we tested the effects of insomnia diagnosis and insomnia treatment on nonrapid eye movement electroencephalography in older adults, distinguishing slow-oscillation and delta power.Methods:In 93 older adults with insomnia and 71 good sleeper control participants (mean ages 68 years), effects of insomnia and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (insomnia group only) on electroencephalographic spectral power were analyzed. Main effects and interactions with nonrapid eye movement period were assessed for the following frequency bands: slow-oscillation (0.5–1 Hz), delta (1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), sigma (12–16 Hz), and beta (16–32 Hz).Results:Slow-oscillation absolute and relative power were lower in the insomnia group compared with controls. There were no group differences in delta power. Insomnia was also associated with elevated 4–32 Hz absolute and relative power. After cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, absolute sigma and beta activity decreased.Conclusions:Deficits in slow-wave activity in insomnia are specific to the slow-oscillation. Elevated high frequency activity is reduced for sigma and beta power following cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia .

  abstract = {In the past few years it has become increasingly clear that insomnia is a chronic disease that interacts with many other medical conditions. As our ability to examine complex physiological activity during sleep has increased, additional evidence continues to suggest that insomnia is associated with inappropriate physiological arousal. It is now known that patients with primary insomnia have increased high-frequency EEG activation, abnormal hormone secretion, increased whole body and brain metabolic activation, and elevated heart rate and sympathetic nervous system activation during sleep. This activation can be measured throughout the day and night and is chronic. Other research suggests that insomnia, probably based upon the associated chronic physiologic arousal, is associated with increased risk for medical disorders such as depression, hypertension, or cardiac disease. An animal model that has used odor stress to produce poor sleep in rats has identified specific activated brain sites similar to those found in human brain metabolic studies to suggest that insomnia is a state in which sleep and arousal systems are both simultaneously active. The animal studies have also shown that the inappropriate arousal can be blocked by lesions in the limbic and arousal systems. It is hoped that these findings can be extended to identify new compounds that improve insomnia by acting at these sites of abnormal brain activation.},

  abstract = {Insomnia disorder is among the most frequent mental disorders, making research on its aetiology and pathophysiology particularly important. A unifying element of many aetiological and pathophysiological models is that they support or even centre on the role of some form of hyperarousal. In this theoretical review, we aim to summarise the current evidence on hyperarousal in insomnia. Hyperarousal is discussed as a state of relatively increased arousal in physiological, cortical and cognitive-emotional domains. Regarding physiological hyperarousal, there is no conclusive evidence for the involvement of autonomous variables such as heart rate and heart rate variability, whereas recent evidence points to a pathophysiological role of neuroendocrine variables. In addition, current literature supports a central involvement of cortical arousal, that is, high-frequency electroencephalographic activity. An increasingly important focus in the literature is on the role of other microstructural sleep parameters, especially the existence of microarousals during sleep. Beyond that, a broad range of evidence exists supporting the role of cognitive-emotional hyperarousal in the form of insomnia-related thought and worries, and their concomitant emotional symptoms. Besides being a state marker of insomnia, hyperarousal is considered crucial for the predisposition to insomnia and for the development of comorbid mental disorders. Thus, beyond presenting evidence from cross-sectional studies on markers of hyperarousal in insomnia, hypotheses about the mechanisms of hyperarousal are presented. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies are needed to further elucidate the mechanism of hyperarousal throughout the course of the disorder, and future studies should also focus on similarities and differences in hyperarousal across different diagnostic entities.},

  abstract = {The electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a non-invasive, minimally restrictive, and relatively low-cost measure of mesoscale brain dynamics with high temporal resolution. Although signals recorded in parallel by multiple, near-adjacent EEG scalp electrode channels are highly-correlated and combine signals from many different sources, biological and non-biological, independent component analysis (ICA) has been shown to isolate the various source generator processes underlying those recordings. Independent components (IC) found by ICA decomposition can be manually inspected, selected, and interpreted, but doing so requires both time and practice as ICs have no order or intrinsic interpretations and therefore require further study of their properties. Alternatively, sufficiently-accurate automated IC classifiers can be used to classify ICs into broad source categories, speeding the analysis of EEG studies with many subjects and enabling the use of ICA decomposition in near-real-time applications. While many such classifiers have been proposed recently, this work presents the ICLabel project comprised of (1) the ICLabel dataset containing spatiotemporal measures for over 200,000 ICs from more than 6000 EEG recordings and matching component labels for over 6000 of those ICs, all using common average reference, (2) the ICLabel website for collecting crowdsourced IC labels and educating EEG researchers and practitioners about IC interpretation, and (3) the automated ICLabel classifier, freely available for MATLAB. The ICLabel classifier improves upon existing methods in two ways: by improving the accuracy of the computed label estimates and by enhancing its computational efficiency.

  abstract = {Estimating insomnia prevalence in epidemiological studies is hampered by variability in definitions and interpretation of criteria. We addressed the absence of a population-based estimate of insomnia in Australia using the widely accepted contemporary International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) criteria, which includes sleep opportunity, and has not been applied in studies to date. Consistent use of these criteria across epidemiological studies, however, requires evidence of the clinical utility of a sleep opportunity criterion for targeting strategies. A cross-sectional national on-line survey (2019 Sleep Health Foundation Insomnia Survey) of Australian adults (18–90 years, n = 2044) was conducted. Chronic insomnia was defined as sleep symptoms and daytime impairment experienced ≥3 times per week, and present for ≥3 months, with adequate sleep opportunity (time in bed (TIB) ≥7.5 hrs). Self-rated general health (SF-1) and ever diagnosed health conditions (including sleep disorders) were assessed. Chronic difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and daytime symptoms (n = 788) were more common in females (41.5\%) than males (35.3\%), p = 0.004. Excluding participants reporting frequent pain causing sleep disruption and TIB {$<$}7.5 hrs generated an insomnia disorder estimate of 25.2\% (95\% CI: 22.5–28.2) in females and 21.1\% (18.4–23.9) in males [23.2\% (21.2–25.2) overall]. This compares with 8.6\% (7.3–10.0) with insomnia symptoms and TIB {$<$}7.5 hrs and 7.5\% (6.4–8.7\%) ever diagnosed with insomnia. Insomnia symptom groups with TIB {$<$}7.5 and ≥7.5 hours demonstrated similar odds of reporting fair/poor health [odds ratio (OR): 3.2 (95\% CI: 2.1–4.8) and 2.9 (95\% CI: 2.2–3.9) respectively], ≥1 mental health condition, ≥1 airway disease, and multimorbidity. Adults with significant sleep and daytime symptomatology and TIB {$<$}7.5 hrs did not differ clinically from those with insomnia disorder. Consideration of criteria, particularly adequate sleep opportunity, is required to consistently identify insomnia, and establish health correlates in future epidemiological studies. Further evaluation of the clinical utility of the sleep opportunity criterion is also required.},

  abstract = {Objectives To investigate slow wave sleep (SWS) spectral power proportions in distinct clinical conditions sharing non-restorative sleep and fatigue complaints without excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), namely the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and primary insomnia (PI). Impaired sleep homeostasis has been suspected in both CFS and PI. Methods We compared perceived sleep quality, fatigue and sleepiness symptom-intensities, polysomnography (PSG) and SWS spectral power distributions of drug-free CFS and PI patients without comorbid sleep or mental disorders, with a good sleeper control group. Results Higher fatigue without EDS and impaired perceived sleep quality were confirmed in both patient groups. PSG mainly differed in sleep fragmentation and SWS durations. Spectral analysis revealed a similar decrease in central ultra slow power (0.3–0.79Hz) proportion during SWS for both CFS and PI and an increase in frontal power proportions of faster frequencies during SWS in PI only. The latter was correlated to affective symptoms whereas lower central ultra slow power proportions were related to fatigue severity and sleep quality impairment. Conclusions In combination with normal (PI) or even increased SWS durations (CFS), we found consistent evidence for lower proportions of slow oscillations during SWS in PI and CFS. Significance Observing normal or increased SWS durations but lower proportions of ultra slow power, our findings suggest a possible quantitative compensation of altered homeostatic regulation.},

This study examined the association between NRS and daytime dysfunction in healthy adults screened for insomnia and sleep apnea. Design Multi-day assessment approach. Setting Community-based adults and college students. Participants Healthy young adults without insomnia and sleep apnea (n = 79; 68\% female, mean age = 27.5, SD = 6.5). Measurements Laboratory protocol included a behavioral assessment of executive functioning (EF), self-report of prior month sleep-related daytime dysfunction, and depressive symptoms in the prior two weeks. Subsequently, participants completed an experience sampling assessment that included morning ratings of NRS, repeat affect ratings throughout the day via palm-pilot, nighttime ratings of pre-sleep arousal and EF disturbances, ambulatory cardiac impedence monitoring, and wrist actigraphy. Results NRS was significantly associated with poorer performance on behaviorally-assessed EF, perceived EF difficulties, daily ratings of fatigue, and past-month reported daytime dysfunction. These associations remained significant after controlling for age and sleep duration (measured by actigraphy). NRS was also associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activation prior to bedtime. Further, reported pre-sleep arousal was associated with NRS, and this association was mediated by perceived EF difficulties. Conclusions Findings indicate that, even among healthy, young adults without insomnia or sleep apnea, NRS is associated with poorer cognitive functioning and may be a precursor to insomnia.},

This study aims to (1) describe insomnia related symptoms and sleep quality in those with NRS compared to those with no NRS; (2) identify the independent associations between NRS, insomnia severity, and depression; and (3) identify the association between NRS and daytime function independent of insomnia severity and depression. Design Cross sectional survey of enrollees at a health plan in the Midwestern United States. Measurement Respondents were surveyed about the presence and frequency of NRS complaints, depression, insomnia severity and related symptoms. Multivariate regression was used to examine the study’s three research aims. Participants Study sample consisted of 541 subjects with NRS and 717 who reported never experiencing any NRS symptoms. Results We found a statistically significant interaction between NRS and total sleep duration such that the association between sleep duration and sleep quality was attenuated in those with NRS compared to those without NRS (b=−0.26, SE=0.07, p{$<$}0.0001). In multivariate analysis, subthreshold, moderate and severe insomnia were associated with NRS (OR [95\%CI]=5.93 [4.24–8.31], 9.22 [6.15–13.83] and 6.10 [3.34–11.14], respectively). NRS was independently associated with daytime physical function, cognitive function and emotional function OR [95\%CI]=2.21 [1.59–3.08], 1.90 [1.37–2.64] and 1.71 [1.23–2.36], respectively. Conclusion NRS is a complex concept that should be further defined and studied in the larger context of sleep quality, other insomnia related symptoms, daytime function and depression.},

Methods Articles were located on MEDLINE and EMBASE. Psychometric properties were appraised using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Results We found thirty-five studies evaluating psychometric properties of the ESS in adults. Of these, 27~studies examined construct validity, 14 – known-group validity, 8 – internal consistency and 4 – test–retest reliability. Study quality ranged from excellent to poor the majority being fair. Internal consistency by Cronbach's alphas was good (0.73–0.86). There is little available evidence on test–retest reliability. Pooled correlations of the ESS with other constructs varied: from moderate (the maintenance of wakefulness test; ρ~=~−0.43), to weak (the multiple sleep latency test; ρ~=~−0.27, and sleep apnea-related variables; ρ from 0.11 to 0.23). Although ESS scores varied significantly across groups of subjects with known differences in DS, not all differences were clinically important. Conclusion There have been relatively few high quality studies on the ESS psychometric properties. The internal consistency of the ESS suggests that this instrument can be recommended for group but not individual-level comparisons. Correlations with other measures of DS were stronger than with sleep apnea-related or general health measures, but still lower than expected. Further studies are required in the areas of test–retest reliability of the ESS.},

Here we assessed how the timing and fluctuating nature of arousal‐related symptoms over the course of the day relate to insomnia symptom severity. In this study, 361 participants (               M               age\,=\,31.9\,years, 282 women, 77 men, 2 non‐binary individuals) completed the Insomnia Severity Index to assess severity of insomnia symptoms, followed by repeated ratings of anxiety or nervousness, stress, sleepiness, and feeling down via their mobile phone between \textasciitilde 08:00\>hours and 00:00\>hours across 1 day. Measures of dynamics included: mean levels across the day; variation (standard deviation); instability (mean squared successive differences); and resistance to change/inertia (first‐order autocorrelation). Time‐of‐day patterns were modelled using generalized additive mixed effects models. Insomnia symptom severity (mean Insomnia Severity Index\,=\,9.1, SD\,=\,5.2, range 0–25) was associated with higher mean levels of all arousal‐related symptoms, and increased instability and variation throughout the day in anxiety or nervousness, stress, and feeling down. Resistance to change (inertia) was not associated with insomnia symptom severity. Generalized additive mixed effects analyses showed that while individuals with more severe insomnia symptoms had elevated symptoms across the entire day, they were especially more anxious or nervous and sleepy in the early morning (\textasciitilde 08:00\>hours), anxious or nervous, stressed and sleepy in the late afternoon/early evening (\textasciitilde 16:00\>hours–21:00\>hours), and anxious or nervous and stressed in the late evening (\textasciitilde 22:00\>hours). Remarkably, higher arousal occurred in the presence of high subjective sleepiness. Together these results indicate that insomnia symptom severity is associated with problems with daytime and evening arousal regulation.},

  abstract = {Summary             Insomnia disorder comprises symptoms during night and day that strongly affect quality of life and wellbeing. Prolonged sleep latency, difficulties to maintain sleep and early morning wakening characterize sleep complaints, whereas fatigue, reduced attention, impaired cognitive functioning, irritability, anxiety and low mood are key daytime impairments. Insomnia disorder is well acknowledged in all relevant diagnostic systems: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, 5th revision, International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd version, and International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision. Insomnia disorder as a chronic condition is frequent (up to 10\% of the adult population, with a preponderance of females), and signifies an important and independent risk factor for physical and, especially, mental health. Insomnia disorder diagnosis primarily rests on self‐report. Objective measures like actigraphy or polysomnography are not (yet) part of the routine diagnostic canon, but play an important role in research. Disease concepts of insomnia range from cognitive‐behavioural models to (epi‐) genetics and psychoneurobiological approaches. The latter is derived from knowledge about basic sleep–wake regulation and encompass theories like rapid eye movement sleep instability/restless rapid eye movement sleep. Cognitive‐behavioural models of insomnia led to the conceptualization of cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia, which is now considered as first‐line treatment for insomnia worldwide. Future research strategies will include the combination of experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and may benefit from more attention to dysfunctional overnight alleviation of distress in insomnia. With respect to therapy, cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia merits widespread implementation, and digital cognitive‐behavioural therapy may assist delivery along treatment guidelines. However, given the still considerable proportion of patients responding insufficiently to cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia, fundamental studies are highly necessary to better understand the brain and behavioural mechanisms underlying insomnia. Mediators and moderators of treatment response/non‐response and the associated development of tailored and novel interventions also require investigation. Recent studies suggest that treatment of insomnia may prove to add significantly as a preventive strategy to combat the global burden of mental disorders.},

We retrospectively analysed data from 123 patients with insomnia disorder and 123 age- and gender-matched good sleeper controls who completed a simple subjective habitual sleep duration question (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), a sleep diary (5–14 days), 2 nights of polysomnography, and two corresponding morning subjective estimates of sleep duration. Descriptive statistics, linear regression analyses and Bland–Altman plots were used to describe the relationship and (dis)agreement between sleep duration measures. Relationships between polysomnography and the simple question as well as between polysomnography and sleep diary were weak to non-existent. Subjective measures and polysomnography did not agree. Sleep duration measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index or sleep diary was about 2 hr above or up to 4 hr below polysomnography-measured sleep duration. Patients with insomnia disorder, on average, reported shorter sleep duration compared with polysomnography, while good sleeper controls, on average, reported longer sleep duration compared with polysomnography. The results suggest that subjective and objective measures apparently capture different aspects of sleep, even when nominally addressing the same value (sleep duration). They disagree in both patients with insomnia disorder and good sleeper controls, but in different directions. Studies assessing sleep duration should take into account both the investigated population and the assessment method when interpreting results. Future studies should continue to investigate possible psychological and physiological correlates of sleep (mis)perception.},

  abstract = {Sleepiness is a key issue in sleep medicine but its definition remains ambiguous and difficult to address. Some studies have reported that sleepiness should be conceptualized as a multidimensional construct. One of these dimensions is sleepiness propensity accurately assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. However, in the literature, data on other important sleepiness dimensions, such as sleepiness perception, are lacking. In an attempt to fulfil the literature gaps, this study aims at presenting data regarding the development of a brief self-report instrument to assess daytime sleepiness perception, the Daytime Sleepiness Perception Scale (DSPS-4). A sample of 692 undergraduate Medicine students was initially enrolled. The sample was randomly split in order to perform independent exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). A one-factor solution was examined. The DSPS-4 showed good indicators of reliability and validity. The CFA confirmed the one-factor structure of the DSPS-4. The unidimensional structure of the scale was invariant for both sexes. Results highlight the usefulness of DSPS-4 to measure and assess sleepiness perception at daytime. The short length of this scale enables its incorporation in routine assessment protocols for example regarding insomnia complaints. However, more studies are now required to check its suitability for other samples, specifically well-defined clinical groups.},

High-density EEG (Hd-EEG) has also detected local parietal deficits in SWA (delta power) during NREM. It is unclear whether effective continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment reverses regional SWA deficits, and other regional sleep and wake EEG abnormalities, and whether any recovery relates to improved overnight memory consolidation.                                         Methods               A clinical sample of men with moderate-severe OSA underwent sleep and resting wake recordings with 256-channel Hd-EEG before and after 3 months of CPAP. Declarative and procedural memory tasks were administered pre- and post-sleep. Topographical spectral power maps and differences between baseline and treatment were compared using t-tests and statistical nonparametric mapping (SnPM).                                         Results               In 11 compliant CPAP users (5.2\>±\>1.1 hours/night), total sleep time did not differ after CPAP but N1 and N2 sleep were lower and N3 was higher. Centro-parietal gamma power during N3 increased and fronto-central slow spindle activity during N2 decreased (SnPM\>\&lt;\>0.05). No other significant differences in EEG power were observed. When averaged specifically within the parietal region, N3 delta power increased after CPAP (p\>=\>0.0029) and was correlated with the change in overnight procedural memory consolidation (rho\>=\>0.79, p\>=\>0.03). During resting wakefulness, there were trends for reduced delta and theta power.                                         Conclusions               Effective CPAP treatment of OSA may correct regional EEG abnormalities, and regional recovery of SWA may relate to procedural memory improvements in the short term.},

  abstract = {Fourteen male rotating threeshift workers were subjected to 24-h ambulatory polysomnographic recording in connection with morning, afternoon, and night shift work (at home and at work). Total sleep time, stage 2, rapid-eye-movement sleep, and slow-wave sleep (stages 3 + 4) were significantly reduced during sleep in connection with the night and morning shifts. Other visually scored sleep parameters and slow-wave energy (spectral power density integrated across sleep) were not affected. The content of the sleep cycles did not differ between shifts. The sleep before the morning shift was characterized by subjectively increased difficulties of sleep initiation and sleep termination, as well as by insufficient recuperation. The night shift was characterized by increased subjective difficulties of maintaining sleep, but also by increased ease of sleep initiation. It was concluded that both morning and evening shifts interfered with sleep, although no effects of sleep deprivation were found.}

  abstract = {Functional activation as evidenced by blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI changes or event-related EEG is known to closely follow patterns of stimulation or self-paced action. Any lags are compatible with axonal conduction velocities and neural integration times. The important analysis of resting state networks is generally based on the assumption that these principles also hold for spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity. Previous observations using simultaneous EEG and fMRI indicate that slower processes, with delays in the seconds range, determine at least part of the relationship between spontaneous EEG and fMRI. To assess this relationship systematically, we used deconvolution analysis of EEG-fMRI during the resting state, assessing the relationship between EEG frequency bands and fMRI BOLD across the whole brain while allowing for time lags of up to 10.5s. Cluster analysis, identifying similar BOLD time courses in relation to EEG band power peaks, showed a clear segregation of functional subsystems of the brain. Our analysis shows that fMRI BOLD increases commonly precede EEG power increases by seconds. Most zero-lag correlations, on the other hand, were negative. This indicates two main distinct neuromodulatory mechanisms: an “idling” mechanism of simultaneous electric and metabolic network anticorrelation and a “regulatory” mechanism in which metabolic network activity precedes increased EEG power by some seconds. This has to be taken into consideration in further studies which address the causal and functional relationship of metabolic and electric brain activity patterns.},

The ATS scale was designed as a method for integrating subjective sleepiness over longer time periods. The subjects were asked if certain symptoms of sleepiness had occurred and, if so, for how long. Six subjects participated twice. Each time they were kept awake during the night (except for a short nap occurring during one of the nights in a counterbalanced order) and were tested at 2200, 0200, 0400 and 0600 hours. The tests included a 10-minute rest period, a 28-minute visual vigilance task and an 11-minute single reaction time task. KSS and visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings were given before each test, and ATS ratings were given after. Performance deteriorated clearly, and all three rating scales reflected increased sleepiness with time of night. Scores on the KSS and VAS showed high correlations with performance tasks (mean intraindividual correlations were between 0.49 and 0.71). Performance correlated even higher with the ATS ratings (r = 0.73-0.79). Intercorrelations between rating scales were also high (r = 0.65-0.86). It was concluded that there were strong relations between ratings of sleepiness and performance, that the ATS rating scale was at least as good as the other scales and that the ratings were affected by type of task.},

The aim of this meta-analysis is to investigate whether insomnia also predicts the onset of other mental disorders. Longitudinal studies were eligible for inclusion if they investigated insomnia at baseline (including nighttime- and daytime-symptoms) as a predictor of the later onset of psychopathology within a follow-up time-frame of at least 12 mo. Thirteen primary studies were included. The results suggest that insomnia is a significant predictor for the onset of depression (10 studies, OR 2.83, CI 1.55–5.17), anxiety (six studies, OR 3.23, CI 1.52–6.85), alcohol abuse (two studies, OR 1.35, CI 1.08–1.67, and psychosis (one study, OR 1.28, CI 1.03–1.59). The overall risk of bias in the primary studies was moderate. This meta-analysis provides evidence that insomnia increases the risk for psychopathology. A future research agenda should include more prospective studies using established diagnostic criteria, assessing insomnia at baseline and including long-term follow-up intervals evaluating a wider range of mental disorders. In addition, prospective long-term interventional studies investigating the efficacy of insomnia treatment for the prevention of mental disorders are called for.},

  abstract = {Diagnostic manuals describe insomnia disorder (ID) characterised by fatigue and sleepiness as diurnal consequences of nocturnal symptoms. However, patients with ID do not frequently report sleepiness in the clinical setting. The present study aimed to investigate subjective sleepiness in ID measured through the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and its independence towards daytime functioning and fatigue, and to evaluate cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improvement in daytime consequences and their relationship to sleepiness and fatigue. We retrospectively collected the ESS evaluation in a large sample of 105 healthy controls (HCs), 671 patients with ID, and 602 patients with sleep disorders characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Moreover, we conducted a pre–post evaluation of the ESS in a sub-sample of patients with ID who underwent CBT-I. Component 2 of the Insomnia Severity Index and Profile of Mood States–Fatigue Inertia Scale was used to evaluate daytime functioning and fatigue. Patients with ID reported ESS levels comparable to that observed in HCs and significantly lower than the EDS group. No significant correlation arose between ESS and the diurnal impact of the disorder, suggesting the independence between daytime functioning and sleepiness in ID. Contrarily, insomnia severity and diurnal impact significantly correlated with fatigue. Data showed a statistically significant increase in sleepiness after CBT-I, despite significantly improving daytime consequences and fatigue. Although diagnostic manuals report sleepiness and fatigue as daytime consequences of sleep symptoms in patients with ID, these retrospective data indicate a dissociation between these entities. This evidence aligns with the core feature of ID: the hyperarousal status that pervades patients also during wakefulness.},

  abstract = {The electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a non-invasive, minimally restrictive, and relatively low-cost measure of mesoscale brain dynamics with high temporal resolution. Although signals recorded in parallel by multiple, near-adjacent EEG scalp electrode channels are highly-correlated and combine signals from many different sources, biological and non-biological, independent component analysis (ICA) has been shown to isolate the various source generator processes underlying those recordings. Independent components (IC) found by ICA decomposition can be manually inspected, selected, and interpreted, but doing so requires both time and practice as ICs have no order or intrinsic interpretations and therefore require further study of their properties. Alternatively, sufficiently-accurate automated IC classifiers can be used to classify ICs into broad source categories, speeding the analysis of EEG studies with many subjects and enabling the use of ICA decomposition in near-real-time applications. While many such classifiers have been proposed recently, this work presents the ICLabel project comprised of (1) the ICLabel dataset containing spatiotemporal measures for over 200,000 ICs from more than 6000 EEG recordings and matching component labels for over 6000 of those ICs, all using common average reference, (2) the ICLabel website for collecting crowdsourced IC labels and educating EEG researchers and practitioners about IC interpretation, and (3) the automated ICLabel classifier, freely available for MATLAB. The ICLabel classifier improves upon existing methods in two ways: by improving the accuracy of the computed label estimates and by enhancing its computational efficiency. The classifier outperforms or performs comparably to the previous best publicly available automated IC component classification method for all measured IC categories while computing those labels ten times faster than that classifier as shown by a systematic comparison against other publicly available EEG IC classifiers.},

Methods               Standard PSG and MSLT were recorded in 31 chronic insomniacs (CIs) (21 females, mean age 36.19) and in 21 normal controls (NCs) (18 females, mean age 34.76). EEG spectral analyses were conducted and relative power was obtained for each sleep stage during PSG and each session during MSLTs. Subsequently, CIs were subdivided based on sleep efficiency (SE \&lt; or ≥ 85\%) or mean sleep latency (MSL) of MSLT (\&lt; or ≥ 15 min), and beta power was compared among NCs and CIs subgroups. General liner regression analyses of beta power and PSG parameters were conducted.                                         Results               CIs had significantly greater beta power in nighttime W, N1, N2, NREM, and in total overnight and in MSLT sessions compared with NCs. CIs with lower PSG-SE or longer MSLT-MSL showed higher beta power at nighttime. Compared with NCs, increased beta power was limited to CIs with lower PSG-SE or longer MSLT-MSL during MSLT sessions. In all subjects, total daytime beta was positively correlated to total overnight beta and MSL, total overnight beta was negatively related to SE. In CIs, total daytime beta and total overnight beta were positively correlated.

  abstract = {Insomnia disorder affects a large proportion of the population on a situational, recurrent or chronic basis and is among the most common complaints in medical practice. The disorder is predominantly characterized by dissatisfaction with sleep duration or quality and difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, along with substantial distress and impairments of daytime functioning. It can present as the chief complaint or, more often, co-occurs with other medical or psychiatric disorders, such as pain and depression. Persistent insomnia has been linked with adverse long-term health outcomes, including diminished quality of life and physical and psychological morbidity. Despite its high prevalence and burden, the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia is poorly understood. In the past decade, important changes in classification and diagnostic paradigms have instigated a move from a purely symptom-based conceptualization to the recognition of insomnia as a disorder in its own right. These changes have been paralleled by key advances in therapy, with generic pharmacological and psychological interventions being increasingly replaced by approaches that have sleep-specific and insomnia-specific therapeutic targets. Psychological and pharmacological therapies effectively reduce the time it takes to fall asleep and the time spent awake after sleep onset, and produce a modest increase in total sleep time; these are outcomes that correlate with improvements in daytime functioning. Despite this progress, several challenges remain, including the need to improve our knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie insomnia and to develop more cost-effective, efficient and accessible therapies.},

  abstract = {Human electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations characterize specific behavioral and vigilance states. The frequency of these oscillations is typically sufficient to distinguish a given state; however, theta oscillations (4–8 Hz) have instead been found in near-opposite conditions of drowsiness during sleep deprivation and alert cognitive control. While the latter has been extensively studied and is often referred to as “frontal midline theta,” (fmTheta) the former has been investigated far less but is considered a marker for sleep pressure during wake. In this study we investigated to what extent theta oscillations differed during cognitive tasks and sleep deprivation. We measured high-density EEG in 18 young healthy adults (nine female) performing six tasks under three levels of sleep deprivation. We found both cognitive load and sleep deprivation increased theta power in medial prefrontal cortical areas; however, sleep deprivation caused additional increases in theta in many other, predominantly frontal, areas. The sources of sleep deprivation theta (sdTheta) were task dependent, with a visual-spatial task and short-term memory (STM) task showing the most widespread effects. Notably, theta was highest in supplementary motor areas during passive music listening, and highest in the inferior temporal cortex (responsible for object recognition) during a spatial game. Furthermore, while changes in task performance were correlated with increases in theta during sleep deprivation, this relationship was not specific to the EEG of the same task and did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Altogether, these results suggest that both during sleep deprivation and cognition theta oscillations may preferentially occur in cortical areas not involved in ongoing behavior.                            SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               Electroencephalographic (EEG) research in sleep has often remained separate from research in cognition. This has led to two incompatible interpretations of the function of theta brain oscillations (4–8 Hz): that they reflect local sleep events during sleep deprivation, or that they reflect cognitive processing during tasks. With this study, we found no fundamental differences between theta oscillations during cognition and theta during sleep deprivation that would suggest different functions. Instead, our results indicate that in both cases, theta oscillations are generated by cortical areas not required for ongoing behavior. Therefore, at least in humans, theta may reflect either cortical disengagement or inhibition.},

  abstract = {Background Polysomnography (PSG) is not recommended as a diagnostic tool in insomnia. However, this consensual approach might be tempered in the light of two ongoing transformations in sleep research: big data and artificial intelligence (AI). Method We analyzed the PSG of 347 patients with chronic insomnia, including 59 with Sleep State Misperception (SSM) and 288 without (INS). 89 good sleepers (GS) were used as controls. PSGs were compared regarding: (1) macroscopic indexes derived from the hypnogram, (2) mesoscopic indexes extracted from the electroencephalographic (EEG) spectrum, (3) sleep microstructure (slow waves, spindles). We used supervised algorithms to differentiate patients from GS. Results Macroscopic features illustrate the insomnia conundrum, with SSM patients displaying similar sleep metrics as GS, whereas INS patients show a deteriorated sleep. However, both SSM and INS patients showed marked differences in EEG spectral components (meso) compared to GS, with reduced power in the delta band and increased power in the theta/alpha, sigma and beta bands. INS and SSM patients showed decreased spectral slope in NREM. INS and SSM patients also differed from GS in sleep microstructure with fewer and slower slow waves and more and faster sleep spindles. Importantly, SSM and INS patients were almost indistinguishable at the meso and micro levels. Accordingly, unsupervised classifiers can reliably categorize insomnia patients and GS (Cohen's κ~=~0.87) but fail to tease apart SSM and INS patients when restricting classifiers to micro and meso features (κ=0.004). Conclusion AI analyses of PSG recordings can help moving insomnia diagnosis beyond subjective complaints and shed light on the physiological substrate of insomnia.},

However, patients with ID do not frequently report sleepiness in the clinical setting. The present study aimed to investigate subjective sleepiness in ID measured through the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and its independence towards daytime functioning and fatigue, and to evaluate cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improvement in daytime consequences and their relationship to sleepiness and fatigue. We retrospectively collected the ESS evaluation in a large sample of 105 healthy controls (HCs), 671 patients with ID, and 602 patients with sleep disorders characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Moreover, we conducted a pre–post evaluation of the ESS in a sub-sample of patients with ID who underwent CBT-I. Component 2 of the Insomnia Severity Index and Profile of Mood States–Fatigue Inertia Scale was used to evaluate daytime functioning and fatigue. Patients with ID reported ESS levels comparable to that observed in HCs and significantly lower than the EDS group. No significant correlation arose between ESS and the diurnal impact of the disorder, suggesting the independence between daytime functioning and sleepiness in ID. Contrarily, insomnia severity and diurnal impact significantly correlated with fatigue. Data showed a statistically significant increase in sleepiness after CBT-I, despite significantly improving daytime consequences and fatigue. Although diagnostic manuals report sleepiness and fatigue as daytime consequences of sleep symptoms in patients with ID, these retrospective data indicate a dissociation between these entities. This evidence aligns with the core feature of ID: the hyperarousal status that pervades patients also during wakefulness.},

Here we review literature on the measurement of HRQoL in insomnia populations, and the extent to which insomnia treatment improves domains of HRQoL. It is concluded from the relatively small literature that insomnia impacts on diverse areas of~HRQoL, and that both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions can produce, to varying degrees, improvements in domains spanning physical, social and emotional functioning. Limitations of the current literature are identified; with particular emphasis on measurement and conceptual shortcomings. Suggestions are made in relation to improving the quality of future research, and how to further shed light on the impact of insomnia – and treatment thereof – on both HRQoL and global quality of life.},

  abstract = {Although fatigue is common in insomnia, the clinical associates of fatigue in patients with insomnia are largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the clinical associates of fatigue in patients with insomnia. Patients visiting the Stanford Sleep Medicine Center completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Among 6367 patients, 2024 were diagnosed with insomnia (age 43.06\,±\,15.19 years; 1110 women and 914 men) according to the ISI and the ISQ. Insomnia patients with severe fatigue (n\,=\,1306) showed higher insomnia symptoms, daytime sleepiness, depression and longer habitual sleep duration than those without severe fatigue (n\,=\,718). Higher insomnia symptoms, daytime sleepiness and depressive symptoms, and longer habitual sleep duration, independently predicted higher fatigue scores. Among insomnia patients with daytime sleepiness (ESS≥10), only habitual sleep duration and depression predicted fatigue scores. The interaction between insomnia severity and daytime sleepiness significantly predicted the severity of fatigue. Depression was a significant mediator between insomnia and fatigue. For 598 insomnia patients undergoing overnight polysomnography (PSG), no significant correlations were found between fatigue and any PSG parameters. The current study suggests that managing insomnia or depression may reduce the fatigue of insomnia patients, whereas arbitrary efforts to prolong sleep duration may worsen their fatigue.},

Therefore understanding the mechanisms which predispose an individual to developing insomnia has great transdiagnostic value. However, whilst it is largely accepted that a vulnerable phenotype exists there is a lack of research which aims to systematically assess the make-up of this phenotype. This review outlines the research to-date, considering familial aggregation and the genetics and psychology of stress-reactivity. A model will be presented in which negative affect (neuroticism) and genetics (5HTTLPR) are argued to lead to disrupted sleep via an increase in stress-reactivity, and further that the interaction of these variables leads to an increase in learned negative associations, which further increase the likelihood of poor sleep and the development of insomnia.},

Mean age was 22.5 ± 2.8 years; gender distribution was 59\% women.Sleep reactivity was measured using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST). The criterion for insomnia was having difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or nonrefreshing sleep “usually or always” for ≥ 1 month, with at least “somewhat” interference with daily functioning.The prevalence of insomnia was 21\%. Heritability estimates for sleep reactivity were 29\% for females and 43\% for males. The environmental variance for sleep reactivity was greater for females and entirely due to nonshared effects. Insomnia was 43\% to 55\% heritable for males and females, respectively; the sex difference was not significant. The genetic variances in insomnia and FIRST scores were correlated (r = 0.54 in females, r = 0.64 in males), as were the environmental variances (r = 0.32 in females, r = 0.37 in males). In terms of individual insomnia symptoms, difficulty staying asleep (25\% to 35\%) and nonrefreshing sleep (34\% to 35\%) showed relatively more genetic influences than difficulty falling asleep (0\%).Sleep reactivity to stress has a substantial genetic component, as well as an environmental component. The finding that FIRST scores and insomnia symptoms share genetic influences is consistent with the hypothesis that sleep reactivity may be a genetic vulnerability for developing insomnia.},

  abstract = {In humans, EEG power in the theta frequency band (5–8 Hz) during quiet waking increases during sleep deprivation (SD), and predicts the subsequent homeostatic increase of sleep slow-wave activity (SWA; EEG power between 0.5 and 4.0 Hz). These findings indicate that theta power in waking is an EEG variable, which reflects the rise in sleep propensity. In rodents, a number of short sleep attempts, as well as SWA in the waking EEG increase in the course of SD, but neither variable predicts the subsequent homeostatic increase of EEG SWA during recovery sleep. To investigate whether there is an EEG marker for sleep propensity also in rodents, the EEG of the rat was recorded during 6 h SD in the first half of the light period (SDL, n~=~7). During SDL, power of the waking EEG showed an increase in the delta (1.5–4 Hz) and low theta (5–6.5 Hz) band. Based on the neck muscle EMG, wakefulness was subdivided into active (high EMG activity) and quiet (low EMG activity) waking. During quiet waking, the theta peak occurred at 5.5 Hz, the frequency at which the increase of EEG power during SD was most pronounced. This increase was due to higher amplitude of theta waves, while wave incidence (frequency) was unchanged. Correlation analysis showed that the rise in EEG power in the 5–7 Hz band during SD predicted the subsequent enhancement of SWA in non-rapid eye movement sleep. The analysis of data of a further batch of rats which were sleep deprived for 6 h after dark onset (SDD, n~=~7) revealed a significant increase in theta-wave amplitude during the SD and a tendency for a similar, positive correlation between the increase of theta power (5–7 Hz) and subsequent SWA. The results indicate that in rats, as in humans, a specific waking EEG frequency, i.e., theta power in quiet waking is a marker of sleep propensity.},

  abstract = {Feeling awake although sleep recordings indicate clear-cut sleep sometimes occurs in good sleepers and to an extreme degree in patients with so-called paradoxical insomnia. It is unknown what underlies sleep misperception, as standard polysomnographic (PSG) parameters are often normal in these cases. Here we asked whether regional changes in brain activity could account for the mismatch between objective and subjective total sleep times (TST). To set cutoffs and define the norm, we first evaluated sleep perception in a population-based sample, consisting of 2,092 individuals who underwent a full PSG at home and estimated TST the next day. We then compared participants with a low mismatch (normoestimators, n = 1,147, ±0.5 SD of mean) with those who severely underestimated (n = 52, {$<$}2.5th percentile) or overestimated TST (n = 53, {$>$}97.5th percentile). Compared with normoestimators, underestimators displayed higher electroencephalographic (EEG) activation (beta/delta power ratio) in both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, while overestimators showed lower EEG activation (significant in REM sleep). To spatially map these changes, we performed a second experiment, in which 24 healthy subjects and 10 insomnia patients underwent high-density sleep EEG recordings. Similarly to underestimators, patients displayed increased EEG activation during NREM sleep, which we localized to central-posterior brain areas. Our results indicate that a relative shift from low- to high-frequency spectral power in central-posterior brain regions, not readily apparent in conventional PSG parameters, is associated with underestimation of sleep duration. This challenges the concept of sleep misperception, and suggests that instead of misperceiving sleep, insomnia patients may correctly perceive subtle shifts toward wake-like brain activity.},

  abstract = {Sleep deprivation is commonplace in modern society, but its far-reaching effects on cognitive performance are only beginning to be understood from a scientific perspective. While there is broad consensus that insufficient sleep leads to a general slowing of response speed and increased variability in performance, particularly for simple measures of alertness, attention and vigilance, there is much less agreement about the effects of sleep deprivation on many higher level cognitive capacities, including perception, memory and executive functions. Central to this debate has been the question of whether sleep deprivation affects nearly all cognitive capacities in a global manner through degraded alertness and attention, or whether sleep loss specifically impairs some aspects of cognition more than others. Neuroimaging evidence has implicated the prefrontal cortex as a brain region that may be particularly susceptible to the effects of sleep loss, but perplexingly, executive function tasks that putatively measure prefrontal functioning have yielded inconsistent findings within the context of sleep deprivation. Whereas many convergent and rule-based reasoning, decision making and planning tasks are relatively unaffected by sleep loss, more creative, divergent and innovative aspects of cognition do appear to be degraded by lack of sleep. Emerging evidence suggests that some aspects of higher level cognitive capacities remain degraded by sleep deprivation despite restoration of alertness and vigilance with stimulant countermeasures, suggesting that sleep loss may affect specific cognitive systems above and beyond the effects produced by global cognitive declines or impaired attentional processes. Finally, the role of emotion as a critical facet of cognition has received increasing attention in recent years and mounting evidence suggests that sleep deprivation may particularly affect cognitive systems that rely on emotional data. Thus, the extent to which sleep deprivation affects a particular cognitive process may depend on several factors, including the magnitude of global decline in general alertness and attention, the degree to which the specific cognitive function depends on emotion-processing networks, and the extent to which that cognitive process can draw upon associated cortical regions for compensatory support.},

  abstract = {Objective Nonrestorative sleep (NRS) is common in the general global population. This study surveyed the incident/remission rate of NRS and identified related lifestyle factors in a general Japanese adult cohort. Methods Data from a Japanese health check–based cohort between the fiscal years 2011 and 2018 were obtained. NRS was assessed through a single item question, and socio-demographic and clinical data were assessed through self-reports. To identify potential correlates of NRS incidence/remission, Cox regression analysis (or survival analysis) was performed. Results Among the 135~609 individuals surveyed at baseline, data from 93~548 were considered for analysis. NRS exhibited incidence and remission rates of 11.3\% and 15.4\%, respectively. New NRS incidence was predicted by eating fast (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.07, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04–1.10), dining close to bedtime (HR: 1.33, 95\% CI: 1.27–1.38), midnight snacking (HR: 1.09, 95\% CI: 1.04–1.13), skipping breakfast (HR: 1.16, 95\% CI: 1.10–1.22), non-regular exercise (HR: 1.12, 95\% CI: 1.07–1.17), lower levels of physical activity (HR: 1.19, 95\% CI: 1.14–1.24), and slow walking speed (HR: 1.34, 95\% CI: 1.29–1.39), while heavy drinking was less predictive of NRS. However, the same factors (except for heavy drinking) were found to predict NRS remission. Conclusions We found that unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, particularly dining close to bedtime and slow walking speed, were positively associated with NRS incidence, while they were negatively associated with NRS remission. These results can be useful in developing more effective health promotion policies to achieve good sleep.},

  abstract = {Sleepiness interferes with the ability of night-workers and shiftworkers to safely and effectively perform their jobs, and has been increasingly recognized as a major cause of industrial and transportation accidents. Current methods for the assessment of physiological sleepiness levels, such as the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) have several limitations and are particularly impractical in field or occupational studies. In this study, the effectiveness of the Alpha Attenuation Test (AAT) for the quantification of sleepiness has been evaluated and compared to the MSLT during a 40-h sleep deprivation protocol. The AAT, a 12-min eye closed/open protocol, is a quantitative method based on the fact that EEG alpha (8-12 Hz) activity tends to increase with eyes open as individuals get sleepier, while it decreases with eyes closed. In this validation study, the AAT proved to be a sensitive measure of sleepiness induced by sleep deprivation, and it also correlated well with the MSLT. Relative to the MSLT, the AAT has the advantages of being objective, minimally intrusive, and more practical especially in industrial or field studies.},

  abstract = {Attenuation of alpha rhythm in occipital derivation serves as a reliable electroencephalographic (EEG) marker of sleep onset. If such attenuation not only coincides with but also anticipates sleep onset, objective evaluation of sleepiness of permanently waking individuals might be facilitated by probing alpha attenuation immediately after closing eyes. We tested whether alpha-based EEG indexes reflect self-scored sleepiness and objectively measured waking ability. A total of 15 young adults self-scored their sleepiness before and after recording of their resting EEG with a 2-h interval in the course of 43–61-h wakefulness. For each EEG record, power spectra were calculated on 2-min intervals of the eyes open section and on five following 1-min intervals of the eyes closed section. Aking ability was assessed as latency to sleep onset marked by zero-crossing decline of such EEG indexes as alpha-theta power difference in occipital derivation and scores on the second principal component of the EEG spectrum in frontal and occipital derivations. Alpha attenuation during the first minute with eyes closed was found to be significantly related to the levels of subjective sleepiness and waking ability. The relationship between alpha attenuation and subjective sleepiness was confirmed by analysing 1-min eyes closed EEG recordings obtained with a 3-h interval in the course of 24-h sustained wakefulness of 130 adolescents and adults. We concluded that such 1-min eyes closed EEG recordings might be used for simple and quick measurements of sleepiness and waking ability in experimental and field studies of permanently waking individuals.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms alter with ageing and may be aetiologically linked to neurodegeneration. This study explored the association between clinical markers and 1) dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) time and 2) phase angle derived from sleep midpoint, in older adults with varying dementia risks. Participants completed 14 days of actigraphy followed by in-lab measurement of salivary melatonin, from which DLMO time and phase angle were computed. Eighty participants (age~=~65.5, SD~=~9.6), 44 males (55\%), MMSE (28.6, SD~=~1.5) were included in the analysis. Sex (t~=~2.15, p =~.04), sleep onset (r~=~0.49, p {$<~$}.001) and midpoint (r~=~0.44, p {$<~$}.001) also correlated with DLMO time. Multiple linear regression showed chronotype, average actigraphy-derived light exposure during the DLMO window (window 2~h prior to DLMO to 2~h post), early biological day (6–10~h post DLMO time) and late biological day (10–14~h post DLMO time) were predictive of DLMO time (adjusted R2~=~0.75). Sleep offset, depression severity, average light exposure during the early biological night and early and late biological day were shown to be predictive variables in the estimation of phase angle (adjusted R2~=~0.78). The current study highlights the potential use of clinical variables, such as actigraphy-derived light, as circadian markers in ageing which could be easily implemented into existing clinical practice and could yield potential targets focusing on chronotherapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {Background: Insomnia is a prevalent health complaint that is often difficult to evaluate reliably. There is an important need for brief and valid assessment tools to assist practitioners in the clinical evaluation of insomnia complaints.Objective: This paper reports on the clinical validation of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) as a brief screening measure of insomnia and as an outcome measure in treatment research. The psychometric properties (internal consistency, concurrent validity, factor structure) of the ISI were evaluated in two samples of insomnia patients.Methods: The first study examined the internal consistency and concurrent validity of the ISI in 145 patients evaluated for insomnia at a sleep disorders clinic. Data from the ISI were compared to those of a sleep diary measure. In the second study, the concurrent validity of the ISI was evaluated in a sample of 78 older patients who participated in a randomized-controlled trial of behavioral and pharmacological therapies for insomnia. Change scores on the ISI over time were compared with those obtained from sleep diaries and polysomnography. Comparisons were also made between ISI scores obtained from patients, significant others, and clinicians.Results: The results of Study 1 showed that the ISI has adequate internal consistency and is a reliable self-report measure to evaluate perceived sleep difficulties. The results from Study 2 also indicated that the ISI is a valid and sensitive measure to detect changes in perceived sleep difficulties with treatment. In addition, there is a close convergence between scores obtained from the ISI patient's version and those from the clinician's and significant other's versions.Conclusions: The present findings indicate that the ISI is a reliable and valid instrument to quantify perceived insomnia severity. The ISI is likely to be a clinically useful tool as a screening device or as an outcome measure in insomnia treatment research.},

A systematic search of three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) from inception to 12 March 2021 was performed. Publications that reported Cronbachʼs alpha for the total ISI score were included. Only psychometric-focussed studies were considered. Meta-analysis was carried out using a random-effects model to derive a pooled estimate of Cronbachʼs alphas. The number of participants in the included publications ranged from 25 to 12,056, with 33 studies (42 estimates) comprising internal consistency coefficients, and a combined sample size of N = 29,688. The age range of the included publications was from 13.4 to 74.3 years. Data extraction implied 33 publications out of 706 found through the database search. Cronbachʼs alphas ranged from 0.65 to 0.92. The majority of the reported coefficients were ≥0.7 and presented a low risk of bias (n = 32). The pooled alpha coefficient was 0.83 (IC [0.81–0.85]; SE = 0.009) with high heterogeneity among the included publications (I2 = 97\%). Subgroup analyses including moderators such as continent, setting, risk of bias, and age did not affect significantly the overall result. In general, the cumulative estimate of Cronbachʼs alpha for the ISI is good. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution since there is a high heterogeneity level and some of the studies might not have checked the assumptions underlying Cronbach's alphas.},

Despite their different implications in terms of diagnosis and treatment, these two terms are often used interchangeably, or merged under the more general lay term of ‘tired’. Sleepiness is multidimensional and has many causes (multidetermined) and distinguished from fatigue by a presumed impairment of the normal arousal mechanism. Despite its ubiquity, no clear consensus exits as yet as to what constitutes sleepiness. Definitions of sleepiness, to date, are at best operational definitions, conceptualized so as to produce specific assessment instruments. As a result, while a number of subjective and objective measurement tools have been developed to measure sleepiness, each only captures a limited aspect of an otherwise heterogeneous entity. Fatigue is an equally complex phenomenon, its nature captured by a number of conceptualizations and definitions. Measures of fatigue have remained subjective, with a ‘gold standard’ for its measurement remaining elusive. Despite a high prevalence and high degree of morbidity, fatigue has remained a relatively under appreciated symptom, from both a clinical and research point of view.},

  abstract = {Although insomnia is a prevalent complaint with significant morbidity, it often remains unrecognized and untreated. Brief and valid instruments are needed both for screening and outcome assessment. This study examined psychometric indices of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) to detect cases of insomnia in a population-based sample and to evaluate treatment response in a clinical sample.Participants were 959 individuals selected from the community for an epidemiological study of insomnia (Community sample) and 183 individuals evaluated for insomnia treatment and 62 controls without insomnia (Clinical sample). They completed the ISI and several measures of sleep quality, fatigue, psychological symptoms, and quality of life; those in the Clinical sample also completed sleep diaries, polysomnography, and interviews to validate their insomnia/good sleep status and assess treatment response. In addition to standard psychometric indices of reliability and validity, item response theory analyses were computed to examine ISI item response patterns. Receiver operating curves were used to derive optimal cutoff scores for case identification and to quantify the minimally important changes in relation to global improvement ratings obtained by an independent assessor.ISI internal consistency was excellent for both samples (Cronbach α of 0.90 and 0.91). Item response analyses revealed adequate discriminatory capacity for 5 of the 7 items. Convergent validity was supported by significant correlations between total ISI score and measures of fatigue, quality of life, anxiety, and depression. A cutoff score of 10 was optimal (86.1\% sensitivity and 87.7\% specificity) for detecting insomnia cases in the community sample. In the clinical sample, a change score of −8.4 points (95\% CI: −7.1, −9.4) was associated with moderate improvement as rated by an independent assessor after treatment.These findings provide further evidence that the ISI is a reliable and valid instrument to detect cases of insomnia in the population and is sensitive to treatment response in clinical patients.},

To test the construct validity of the short-form version of the Depression anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21), and in particular, to assess whether stress as indexed by this measure is synonymous with negative affectivity (NA) or whether it represents a related, but distinct, construct. To provide normative data for the general adult population. Design. Cross-sectional, correlational and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Methods. The DASS-21 was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N=1,794). Competing models of the latent structure of the DASS-21 were evaluated using CFA. Results. The model with optimal fit (RCFI = 0.94) had a quadripartite structure, and consisted of a general factor of psychological distress plus orthogonal specific factors of depression, anxiety, and stress. This model was a significantly better fit than a competing model that tested the possibility that the Stress scale simply measures NA. Conclusions. The DASS-21 subscales can validly be used to measure the dimensions of depression, anxiety, and stress. However, each of these subscales also taps a more general dimension of psychological distress or NA. The utility of the measure is enhanced by the provision of normative data based on a large sample.},

Of 37 reviewed studies, 22 examined construct validity, 19 – known-group validity, 15 – internal consistency, and three – test-retest reliability. Study quality ranged from poor to excellent, with the majority designated fair. Internal consistency, based on Cronbach's alpha, was good. Discrepancies were observed in factor analytic studies. In non-clinical and clinical samples with known differences in sleep quality, the PSQI global scores and all subscale scores, with the exception of sleep disturbance, differed significantly. The best evidence synthesis for the PSQI showed strong reliability and validity, and moderate structural validity in a variety of samples, suggesting the tool fulfills its intended utility. A taxonometric analysis can contribute to better understanding of sleep dysfunction as either a dichotomous or continuous construct.},

Here, we aimed to further characterize insomnia- and night-related differences in sleep architecture. A comprehensive set of 26 sleep variables was derived from two consecutive nights of polysomnography in 61 age-matched patients with insomnia and 61 good sleeper controls. People with insomnia expressed consistently poorer sleep than controls on several variables during both nights. While poorer sleep during the first night was observed in both groups, there were qualitative differences regarding the specific sleep variables expressing a first-night effect. Short sleep (total sleep time {$<$} 6 hr) was more likely during the first night and in insomnia, although approximately 40\% of patients with insomnia presenting with short sleep on night 1 no longer met this criterion on night 2, which is important given the notion of short-sleeping insomnia as a robust subtype.},

  abstract = {Background:There are validated measures assessing insomnia and disturbed sleep, but few psychometrically sound instruments to assess perceptions of the restorative or inadequate properties of sleep are available.Study Objectives:To develop and evaluate a new instrument, the Restorative Sleep Questionnaire (RSQ).Design and Setting:Focus groups were conducted using participants with and without nonrestorative sleep complaints. Questions were designed to elicit the feelings and experiences people have about their sleep and their view of daytime consequences of sleep. Expert panels confirmed the importance of nonrestorative sleep (NRS) as a frequently encountered problem either with or without other sleep complaints. The resulting RSQ was administered in three studies: (1) a telephone interview with healthy controls and individuals with sleep problems; (2) a randomized clinical trial of patients with primary insomnia assessed by polysomnography (PSG); (3) a PSG study of subjects with NRS complaints.Measurement and Results:Across all studies, the new measures were shown to be significantly correlated with health-related quality of life (HRQL) domains hypothesized to be related to NRS. The RSQ had good psychometric properties (α {$>$} 0.90; rtest-retest {$>$} 0.80), and factor analysis confirmed the unidimensionality of the measure. The RSQ was able to distinguish between healthy controls, patients with primary insomnia, and insomnia patients with isolated NRS complaints but without PSG defined sleep onset, duration, or maintenance problems. Normal sleepers reported sleep that was about a standard deviation more restorative than that of those with NRS on the RSQ.Conclusions:The results of the study provide support for the reliability and validity of the RSQ as a measure of NRS in subjects with and without self-reported or PSG confirmed sleep initiation and maintenance difficulties.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers:NCT00655369; NCT00705601Citation:Drake CL, Hays RD, Morlock R, Wang F, Shikiar R, Frank L, Downey R, Roth T.

This study compared OHS with equally obese obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, with similar apnea-hypopnea indices.                                         Methods               Resting wake and overnight sleep electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, neurocognitive tests, and sleepiness, depression and anxiety scores were assessed before and after 3 months of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy in 15 OHS and 36 OSA patients.                                         Results               Pretreatment, greater slow frequency EEG activity during wake and sleep states (increased delta-alpha ratio during sleep, and theta power during awake) was observed in the OHS group compared to the OSA group. EEG slowing was correlated with poorer performance on the psychomotor vigilance task (slowest 10\% of reciprocal reaction times, psychomotor vigilance test [PVT SRRT], primary outcome), and worse sleep-related hypoxemia measures in OHS. There was no between-group significant difference in PVT performance at pre or post-treatment. Similarly, despite both groups demonstrating improved sleepiness, anxiety and depression scores with PAP therapy, there were no differences in treatment response between the OSA and OHS groups.                                         Conclusion               Patients with OHS have greater slow frequency EEG activity during sleep and wake than equally obese patients with OSA. Greater EEG slowing was associated with worse vigilance and lower oxygenation during sleep.

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms alter with ageing and may be aetiologically linked to neurodegeneration. This study explored the association between clinical markers and 1) dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) time and 2) phase angle derived from sleep midpoint, in older adults with varying dementia risks. Participants completed 14 days of actigraphy followed by in-lab measurement of salivary melatonin, from which DLMO time and phase angle were computed. Eighty participants (age~=~65.5, SD~=~9.6), 44 males (55\%), MMSE (28.6, SD~=~1.5) were included in the analysis. Sex (t~=~2.15, p =~.04), sleep onset (r~=~0.49, p {$<~$}.001) and midpoint (r~=~0.44, p {$<~$}.001) also correlated with DLMO time. Multiple linear regression showed chronotype, average actigraphy-derived light exposure during the DLMO window (window 2~h prior to DLMO to 2~h post), early biological day (6–10~h post DLMO time) and late biological day (10–14~h post DLMO time) were predictive of DLMO time (adjusted R2~=~0.75). Sleep offset, depression severity, average light exposure during the early biological night and early and late biological day were shown to be predictive variables in the estimation of phase angle (adjusted R2~=~0.78). The current study highlights the potential use of clinical variables, such as actigraphy-derived light, as circadian markers in ageing which could be easily implemented into existing clinical practice and could yield potential targets focusing on chronotherapeutic interventions.},

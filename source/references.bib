SWA is a marker of nonREM sleep intensity and may serve as an indicator of sleep homeostasis. The two-process model of sleep regulation posits the interaction of the homeostatic Process S and the circadian Process C. Also models of neurobehavioral functions (three-process model; interactive models of alertness and cognitive throughput) are based on the concept of an interaction between homeostatic and circadian factors. Whether the interaction is linear or non-linear is still unresolved. Models may serve as a guiding principle for specifying the relationship between processes occurring at the macroscopic and microscopic level of analysis.},

  abstract = {Sleep reduction normally causes a homeostatic response during subsequent recovery sleep, but this does not seem to be true for repeated partial sleep loss. The aim of the present study was to test the response to repeated partial sleep loss through detailed focus on spectral data and parts of sleep.The experiment involved 4 h of sleep across 5 days in the laboratory (partial sleep deprivation [PSD]), followed by 3 days of recovery sleep. PSD was achieved through a delayed bedtime. Nine individuals participated. To avoid ``laboratory monotony,'' subjects were permitted to leave the lab for a few hours each day.All sleep stages and the latencies to sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS) showed a significant reduction during PSD. However, SWS and TST (total sleep time) during the first half of sleep increased gradually across days with PSD. During the first recovery sleep, SWS was significantly increased, while stage 1 and latency to stage 3 were reduced. All were back to baseline on the second night of recovery sleep.Summed spectral power during the first 3.8 h of sleep showed a gradual and robust increase (50\% above baseline) in the range 1.25--7.25 Hz across days with PSD up to first recovery sleep and then returned to baseline.SWS and summed power density in a broad low-frequency band respond to repeated partial sleep deprivation in a dose-response fashion during the first 4 h sleep, apparently reflecting a robust and stable homeostatic response to sleep loss.},

  abstract = {The main consequence of insufficient sleep is sleepiness. While measures of sleep latency, continuous encephalographical/electro-oculographical (EEG/EOG) recording and performance tests are useful indicators of sleepiness in the laboratory and clinic, they are not easily implemented in large, real-life field studies. Subjective ratings of sleepiness, which are easily applied and unobtrusive, are an alternative, but whether they measure sleepiness sensitively, reliably and validly remains uncertain. This review brings together research relevant to these issues. It is focused on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), which is a nine-point Likert-type scale. The diurnal pattern of sleepiness is U-shaped, with high KSS values in the morning and late evening, and with great stability across years. KSS values increase sensitively during acute total and repeated partial sleep deprivation and night work, including night driving. The effect sizes range between 1.5 and 3. The relation to driving performance or EEG/EOG indicators of sleepiness is highly significant, strongly curvilinear and consistent across individuals. High ({$>$}6) KSS values are associated particularly with impaired driving performance and sleep intrusions in the EEG. KSS values are also increased in many clinical conditions such as sleep apnea, depression and burnout. The context has a strong influence on KSS ratings. Thus, physical activity, social interaction and light exposure will reduce KSS values by 1--2 units. In contrast, time-on-task in a monotonous context will increase KSS values by 1--2 units. In summary, subjective ratings of sleepiness as described here is as sensitive and valid an indicator of sleepiness as objective measures, and particularly suitable for field studies.},

To understand the neural mechanisms underlying attentional lapses, we studied the behaviour, subjective experience and neural activity of healthy participants performing a task. Random interruptions prompted participants to indicate their mental states as task-focused, mind-wandering or mind-blanking. Using high-density electroencephalography, we report here that spatially and temporally localized slow waves, a pattern of neural activity characteristic of the transition toward sleep, accompany behavioural markers of lapses and preceded reports of mind wandering and mind blanking. The location of slow waves could distinguish between sluggish and impulsive behaviours, and between mind wandering and mind blanking. Our results suggest attentional lapses share a common physiological origin: the emergence of local sleep-like activity within the awake brain.},

The results indicated that both accumulated sleep loss, circadian and ultradian (2 cycles/day) factors were significant in determining subjective estimates of sleepiness. The extent of the differences between subjective sleepiness ratings before cognitive testing and after testing was dependent upon the phase of the circadian cycle. These differences were greatest at approximately 0200---0600 hours and least around 1000 hours. A second low point occurred at 1800-2000 hours. Analysis by complex demodulation of the individual subjects' sleepiness rating curves indicated that the amount of variance accounted for by the circadian component increased significantly after cognitive testing.},

To promote standardization of the PVT and increase its sensitivity and specificity to sleep loss, we determined PVT metrics and task durations that optimally discriminated sleep deprived subjects from alert subjects.Repeated-measures experiments involving 10-min PVT assessments every 2 h across both acute total sleep deprivation (TSD) and 5 days of chronic partial sleep deprivation (PSD).Controlled laboratory environment.74 healthy subjects (34 female), aged 22--45 years.TSD experiment involving 33 h awake (N = 31 subjects) and a PSD experiment involving 5 nights of 4 h time in bed (N = 43 subjects).In a paired t-test paradigm and for both TSD and PSD, effect sizes of 10 different PVT performance outcomes were calculated. Effect sizes were high for both TSD (1.59--1.94) and PSD (0.88--1.21) for PVT metrics related to lapses and to measures of psychomotor speed, i.e., mean 1/RT (response time) and mean slowest 10\% 1/RT. In contrast, PVT mean and median RT outcomes scored low to moderate effect sizes influenced by extreme values. Analyses facilitating only portions of the full 10-min PVT indicated that for some outcomes, high effect sizes could be achieved with PVT durations considerably shorter than 10 min, although metrics involving lapses seemed to profit from longer test durations in TSD.Due to their superior conceptual and statistical properties and high sensitivity to sleep deprivation, metrics involving response speed and lapses should be considered primary outcomes for the 10-min PVT. In contrast, PVT mean and median metrics, which are among the most widely used outcomes, should be avoided as primary measures of alertness. Our analyses also suggest that some shorter-duration PVT versions may be sensitive to sleep loss, depending on the outcome variable selected, although this will need to be confirmed in comparative analyses of separate duration versions of the PVT. Using both sensitive PVT metrics and optimal test durations maximizes the sensitivity of the PVT to sleep loss and therefore potentially decreases the sample size needed to detect the same neurobehavioral deficit. We propose criteria to better standardize the 10-min PVT and facilitate between-study comparisons and meta-analyses.},

Some researchers even question whether we should expect to identify one primary function of sleep, given the multitude of physiological processes that are affected by sleep. But we do know that sleep is homeostatically regulated, and we have discovered a great deal about the physiological mechanisms underlying sleep homeostasis. Other homeostatically regulated behaviors have one or a small number of functions, and those functions are closely linked to the homeostatic control mechanisms for those process. We can therefore apply what is already known about sleep homeostasis to test and evaluate hypothesized functions of sleep. It should be possible to trace the connections between the cellular and molecular basis of a hypothesized function and the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying homeostatic responses to sleep deprivation. Hypothesized functions that do not plausibly admit of such connections can reasonably be rejected. Four current hypotheses suggesting that the function of sleep is to assist in the process of activity-dependent synaptic reorganization are critiqued to demonstrate how what is known about sleep homeostasis can be used to assess hypothesized functions of sleep.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have reported surprisingly few consistent insomnia-characteristics with respect to cognitions, mood, traits, history of life events and family history. One interpretation of this limited consistency is that different subtypes of insomnia exist, each with its own specific multivariate profile of characteristics. Because previously unrecognized subtypes will be differentially represented in individual studies and dilute effect sizes of subtype-dependent characteristics of importance, they are unlikely to be reported consistently in individual studies, let~alone in meta-analyses. This review therefore aims to complement meta-analyses by listing previously reported psychometric characteristics of insomnia, irrespective of the degree of consistency over studies. The review clearly indicates that characteristics of insomnia may not be limited to sleep. Reports suggest that at least some individuals with insomnia may deviate from people without sleep complaints with respect to demographics, mental and physical health, childhood trauma, life events, fatigue, sleepiness, hyperarousal, hyperactivity, other sleep disorders, lifetime sleep history, chronotype, depression, anxiety, mood, quality of life, personality, happiness, worry, rumination, self-consciousness, sensitivity, dysfunctional beliefs, self-conscious emotion regulation, coping, nocturnal mentation, wake resting-state mentation, physical activity, food intake, temperature perception and hedonic evaluation. The value of this list of characteristics is that 1) internet has now made it feasible to asses them all in a large sample of people suffering from insomnia, and 2) statistical methods like latent class analysis and community detection can utilize them for a truly bottom--up data-driven search for subtypes. The supplement to this review provides a blueprint of this multivariate approach as implemented in the Sleep registry platform (www.sleepregistry.nl), that allows for bottom--up subtyping and fosters cross-cultural comparison and worldwide collaboration on insomnia subtype finding -- and beyond.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated that behavioral manipulations targeting specific cortical areas during prolonged wakefulness lead to a region-specific homeostatic increase in theta activity (5--9 Hz), suggesting that theta waves could represent transient neuronal OFF periods (local sleep). In awake rats, the occurrence of an OFF period in a brain area relevant for behavior results in performance errors. Here we investigated the potential relationship between local sleep events and negative behavioral outcomes in humans. Volunteers participated in two prolonged wakefulness experiments (24 h), each including 12 h of practice with either a driving simulation (DS) game or a battery of tasks based on executive functions (EFs). Multiple high-density EEG recordings were obtained during each experiment, both in quiet rest conditions and during execution of two behavioral tests, a response inhibition test and a motor test, aimed at assessing changes in impulse control and visuomotor performance, respectively. In addition, fMRI examinations obtained at 12 h intervals were used to investigate changes in inter-regional connectivity. The EF experiment was associated with a reduced efficiency in impulse control, whereas DS led to a relative impairment in visuomotor control. A specific spatial and temporal correlation was observed between EEG theta waves occurring in task-related areas and deterioration of behavioral performance. The fMRI connectivity analysis indicated that performance impairment might partially depend on a breakdown in connectivity determined by a ``network overload.'' Present results demonstrate the existence of an association between theta waves during wakefulness and performance errors and may contribute explaining behavioral impairments under conditions of sleep deprivation/restriction.},

  abstract = {Although the EEG slow wave of sleep is typically considered to be a hallmark of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, recent work in mice has shown that slow waves can also occur in REM sleep. Here, we investigated the presence and cortical distribution of negative delta (1--4 Hz) waves in human REM sleep by analyzing high-density EEG sleep recordings obtained in 28 healthy subjects. We identified two clusters of delta waves with distinctive properties: (1) a frontal-central cluster characterized by {$\sim$}2.5--3.0 Hz, relatively large, notched delta waves (so-called ``sawtooth waves'') that tended to occur in bursts, were associated with increased gamma activity and rapid eye movements (EMs), and upon source modeling displayed an occipital-temporal and a frontal-central component and (2) a medial-occipital cluster characterized by more isolated, slower ({$<$}2 Hz), and smaller waves that were not associated with rapid EMs, displayed a negative correlation with gamma activity, and were also found in NREM sleep. Therefore, delta waves are an integral part of REM sleep in humans and the two identified subtypes (sawtooth and medial-occipital slow waves) may reflect distinct generation mechanisms and functional roles. Sawtooth waves, which are exclusive to REM sleep, share many characteristics with ponto-geniculo-occipital waves described in animals and may represent the human equivalent or a closely related event, whereas medial-occipital slow waves appear similar to NREM sleep slow waves. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The EEG slow wave is typically considered a hallmark of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, but recent work in mice has shown that it can also occur in REM sleep. By analyzing high-density EEG recordings collected in healthy adult individuals, we show that REM sleep is characterized by prominent delta waves also in humans. In particular, we identified two distinctive clusters of delta waves with different properties: a frontal-central cluster characterized by faster, activating ``sawtooth waves'' that share many characteristics with ponto-geniculo-occipital waves described in animals and a medial-occipital cluster containing slow waves that are more similar to NREM sleep slow waves. These findings indicate that REM sleep is a spatially and temporally heterogeneous state and may contribute to explaining its known functional and phenomenological properties.},

  abstract = {The diagnosis and management of insomnia relies primarily on clinical history. However, patient self-report of sleep--wake times may not agree with objective measurements. We hypothesized that those with shallow or fragmented sleep would under-report sleep quantity, and that this might account for some of the mismatch. We compared objective and subjective sleep--wake times for 277 patients who underwent diagnostic polysomnography. The group included those with insomnia symptoms (n = 92), obstructive sleep apnea (n = 66) or both (n = 119). Mismatch of wake duration was context dependent: all three groups overestimated sleep latency but underestimated wakefulness after sleep onset. The insomnia group underestimated total sleep time by a median of 81 min. However, contrary to our hypothesis, measures of fragmentation (N1, arousal index, sleep efficiency, etc.) did not correlate with the subjective sleep duration estimates. To unmask a potential relationship between sleep architecture and subjective duration, we tested three hypotheses: N1 is perceived as wake; sleep bouts under 10 min are perceived as wake; or N1 and N2 are perceived in a weighted fashion. None of these hypotheses exposed a match between subjective and objective sleep duration. We show only modest performance of a Na{\"i}ve Bayes Classifier algorithm for predicting mismatch using clinical and polysomnographic variables. Subjective--objective mismatch is common in patients reporting insomnia symptoms. We conclude that mismatch was not attributable to commonly measured polysomnographic measures of fragmentation. Further insight is needed into the complex relationships between subjective perception of sleep and conventional, objective measurements.},

  abstract = {In the past few years it has become increasingly clear that insomnia is a chronic disease that interacts with many other medical conditions. As our ability to examine complex physiological activity during sleep has increased, additional evidence continues to suggest that insomnia is associated with inappropriate physiological arousal. It is now known that patients with primary insomnia have increased high-frequency EEG activation, abnormal hormone secretion, increased whole body and brain metabolic activation, and elevated heart rate and sympathetic nervous system activation during sleep. This activation can be measured throughout the day and night and is chronic. Other research suggests that insomnia, probably based upon the associated chronic physiologic arousal, is associated with increased risk for medical disorders such as depression, hypertension, or cardiac disease. An animal model that has used odor stress to produce poor sleep in rats has identified specific activated brain sites similar to those found in human brain metabolic studies to suggest that insomnia is a state in which sleep and arousal systems are both simultaneously active. The animal studies have also shown that the inappropriate arousal can be blocked by lesions in the limbic and arousal systems. It is hoped that these findings can be extended to identify new compounds that improve insomnia by acting at these sites of abnormal brain activation.},

  abstract = {In the last three decades the two-process model of sleep regulation has served as a major conceptual framework in sleep research. It has been applied widely in studies on fatigue and performance and to dissect individual differences in sleep regulation. The model posits that a homeostatic process (Process S) interacts with a process controlled by the circadian pacemaker (Process C), with time-courses derived from physiological and behavioural variables. The model simulates successfully the timing and intensity of sleep in diverse experimental protocols. Electrophysiological recordings from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) suggest that S and C interact continuously. Oscillators outside the SCN that are linked to energy metabolism are evident in SCN-lesioned arrhythmic animals subjected to restricted feeding or methamphetamine administration, as well as in human subjects during internal desynchronization. In intact animals these peripheral oscillators may dissociate from the central pacemaker rhythm. A sleep/fast and wake/feed phase segregate antagonistic anabolic and catabolic metabolic processes in peripheral tissues. A deficiency of Process S was proposed to account for both depressive sleep disturbances and the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation. The model supported the development of novel non-pharmacological treatment paradigms in psychiatry, based on manipulating circadian phase, sleep and light exposure. In conclusion, the model remains conceptually useful for promoting the integration of sleep and circadian rhythm research. Sleep appears to have not only a short-term, use-dependent function; it also serves to enforce rest and fasting, thereby supporting the optimization of metabolic processes at the appropriate phase of the 24-h cycle.},

The current sources and sinks form dipoles or higher-order n-poles.Extracellular currents arise from many sources, including synaptic currents, fast action potentials and their afterpotentials, calcium spikes and voltage-dependent intrinsic currents.The magnitude of extracellular currents depends critically on two factors: the cytoarchitectural organization of a network and the temporal synchrony of the various current sinks and sources.Depending on the recording method, neuroscientists distinguish between electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocorticogram (ECoG) and local field potential (LFP; also known as micro-, depth or intracranial EEG), although all of these measures refer to the same biophysical process.The electric field is the force 'felt' by an electric charge, and can be transmitted through brain volume. The extent of volume conduction depends on the relationships between the current dipole and the features of the conductive medium.High-density sampling of the extracellular field with contemporary methods enables the calculation of current source density, and therefore the localization of current sinks and sources.The voltage gradients generated by highly synchronous activity of neuronal groups can affect the transmembrane potential of the member neurons and alter their excitability through ephaptic coupling.Synchronous spiking of nearby neurons is the main source of the high-frequency components of the local field.There is a discernable relationship between the temporal evolution of cell assemblies and the time-dependent changes of the spatially distributed currents. High-density, wide-band recordings of the local field can therefore provide access to both afferent inputs and the spiking output of neurons.},

This frequency-specific frontal predominance was already present in the first 30 min of recovery sleep, and dissipated in the course of the 8-h sleep episode. The data demonstrate that the enhancement of slow wave EEG activity during sleep following extended wakefulness is most pronounced in frontal cortical areas.}

  abstract = {Objectives To investigate the association of insomnia and chronotype preference with daytime impairment and psychopathology in a community sample of adolescents in Hong Kong. Methods This was a cross-sectional study that included seven local secondary schools in Hong Kong. A total of 1667 adolescents (mean age: 14.8~{\textpm}~1.6 years old; boys: 56.5\%) returned a battery of self-report questionnaires including Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and reduced Horne and {\"O}stberg Morningness and Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ) for assessing insomnia symptoms and chronotype preference, respectively. A subset of adolescent samples (n~=~768) were additionally assessed for suicidal ideation. Potential confounders including age, gender and sleep duration were controlled for in the analyses. Results The prevalence of insomnia symptoms and eveningness chronotype was 37\% and 25.6\%, respectively. Regression models indicated that insomnia and eveningness were independently associated with excessive daytime sleepiness (insomnia: adjusted OR [AdjOR]~=~3.8; 95\% confidence interval [C.I.]~=~2.9--5.0; eveningness: AdjOR~=~2.6; 95\% C.I.~=~1.9--3.7), and an increased risk of depression (insomnia: AdjOR~=~3.5, 95\% C.I.~=~2.5--5.0; eveningness: AdjOR~=~2.0, 95\% C.I.~=~1.3--3.2). The odds ratio increased to 8.7 (95\% C.I.~=~6.1--12.3, p~{$<~$}0.001) for excessive daytime sleepiness and 4.8 (95\% C.I.~=~3.2--7.2, p~{$<~$}0.001) for depression among adolescents with both insomnia and eveningness. Insomnia symptoms, but not eveningness, were associated with anxiety symptoms (AdjOR~=~5.8; 95\% C.I.~=~3.6--9.4) and suicidal ideation (AdjOR~=~2.1, 95\% C.I.~=~1.4--3.2). Conclusions The present study provided further evidence that insomnia and eveningness uniquely contributed to poor daytime functioning and mood related outcomes, while the co-existence of these two conditions could confer a greater risk in adolescents. However, insomnia, but not eveningness, was significantly linked to suicidality after controlling for mood symptoms. Our findings highlighted the necessity of timely management of sleep and circadian issues in adolescents.},

Methods Population-based epidemiological survey respondents (n = 2011) completed the Brief Insomnia Questionnaire (BIQ), a validated scale generating DSM-IV, DSM-5, ICD-10, and ICSD-2 insomnia disorder. Results The weighted prevalence of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking up too early, and non-restorative sleep that occurred {$\geq$}3 days per week was 14.0\%, 28.3\%, 32.1\%, and 39.9\%, respectively. When quantitative criteria were included, the prevalence dropped the most from 39.9\% to 8.4\% for non-restorative sleep, and the least from 14.0\% to 12.9\% for difficulty falling asleep. The weighted prevalence of DSM-IV, ICD-10, ICSD-2, and any of the three insomnia disorders was 22.1\%, 4.7\%, 15.1\%, and 22.1\%, respectively; for DSM-5 insomnia disorder, it was 10.8\%. Conclusion Compared with 22.1\%, 3.9\%, and 14.7\% for DSM-IV, ICD-10, and ICSD-2 in the AIS, cross-cultural difference in the prevalence of insomnia disorder is less than what is expected. The prevalence is reduced by half from DSM-IV to DSM-5. ICD-10 insomnia disorder has the lowest prevalence, perhaps because excessive concern and preoccupation, one of its diagnostic criteria, is not always present in people with insomnia.},

  abstract = {Although daytime complaints are a defining characteristic of insomnia, most EEG studies evaluated sleep only. We used high-density electroencephalography to investigate wake resting state oscillations characteristic of insomnia disorder (ID) at a fine-grained spatiospectral resolution.A case-control assessment during eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) was performed in a laboratory for human physiology. Participants (n = 94, 74 female, 21--70 y) were recruited through www.sleepregistry.nl: 51 with ID, according to DSM-5 and 43 matched controls. Exclusion criteria were any somatic, neurological or psychiatric condition. Group differences in the spectral power topographies across multiple frequencies (1.5 to 40 Hz) were evaluated using permutation-based inference with Threshold-Free Cluster-Enhancement, to correct for multiple comparisons.As compared to controls, participants with ID showed less power in a narrow upper alpha band (11--12.7 Hz, peak: 11.7 Hz) over bilateral frontal and left temporal regions during EO, and more power in a broad beta frequency range (16.3--40 Hz, peak: 19 Hz) globally during EC. Source estimates suggested global rather than cortically localized group differences.The widespread high power in a broad beta band reported previously during sleep in insomnia is present as well during eyes closed wakefulness, suggestive of a round-the-clock hyperarousal. Low power in the upper alpha band during eyes open is consistent with low cortical inhibition and attentional filtering. The fine-grained HD-EEG findings suggest that, while more feasible than PSG, wake EEG of short duration with a few well-chosen electrodes and frequency bands, can provide valuable features of insomnia.Whereas round-the-clock hyperarousal is considered characteristic of insomnia, its representation in wake EEG is insufficiently known. We compared the spatiospectral properties of high-density wake EEG of 51 people with insomnia and 43 matched controls without sleep complaints. Just as previously reported during sleep, people with insomnia show widespread increased beta power during eyes closed wakefulness. During eyes open, their EEG moreover shows relatively little power in a narrow band in the upper-alpha range. The low correlation between these two features suggests they may reflect distinct processes, respectively high arousal and low inhibition. Future studies may employ these measures to evaluate subtypes of insomnia and relevance for variability in profiles of complaints about sleep and daytime functioning.},

However, properly calculating and interpreting metrics used in contemporary sleep EEG requires attention to numerous theoretical and practical signal-processing details that are not always obvious. Moreover, the vast number of outcome measures that can be derived from a single dataset inflates the risk of false positives and threatens replicability. We review several methodological issues related to 1) spectral analysis, 2) montage choice, 3) extraction of phase and amplitude information, 4) surrogate construction, and 5) minimizing false positives, illustrating both the impact of methodological choices on downstream results, and the importance of checking processing steps through visualization and simplified examples. By presenting these issues in non-mathematical form, with sleep-specific examples, and with code implementation, this paper aims to instill a deeper appreciation of methodological considerations in novice and non-technical audiences, and thereby help improve the quality of future sleep EEG studies.},

  abstract = {Insomnia disorder is among the most frequent mental disorders, making research on its aetiology and pathophysiology particularly important. A unifying element of many aetiological and pathophysiological models is that they support or even centre on the role of some form of hyperarousal. In this theoretical review, we aim to summarise the current evidence on hyperarousal in insomnia. Hyperarousal is discussed as a state of relatively increased arousal in physiological, cortical and cognitive-emotional domains. Regarding physiological hyperarousal, there is no conclusive evidence for the involvement of autonomous variables such as heart rate and heart rate variability, whereas recent evidence points to a pathophysiological role of neuroendocrine variables. In addition, current literature supports a central involvement of cortical arousal, that is, high-frequency electroencephalographic activity. An increasingly important focus in the literature is on the role of other microstructural sleep parameters, especially the existence of microarousals during sleep. Beyond that, a broad range of evidence exists supporting the role of cognitive-emotional hyperarousal in the form of insomnia-related thought and worries, and their concomitant emotional symptoms. Besides being a state marker of insomnia, hyperarousal is considered crucial for the predisposition to insomnia and for the development of comorbid mental disorders. Thus, beyond presenting evidence from cross-sectional studies on markers of hyperarousal in insomnia, hypotheses about the mechanisms of hyperarousal are presented. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies are needed to further elucidate the mechanism of hyperarousal throughout the course of the disorder, and future studies should also focus on similarities and differences in hyperarousal across different diagnostic entities.},

The current investigation was conducted to examine the distribution of sleep time misperceptions among a large (n =173), diverse group of insomniacs and to determine if such misperceptions might relate to the patients' clinical characteristics. Consistent with previous studies, our subjects, as a group, produced sleep estimates that were significantly (p \&lt; 0.0001) lower than poly-somnographically determined sleep times. However, patients' sleep time perceptions were widely distributed across a broad continuum, which ranged between gross underestimates and remarkable overestimates of actual sleep times. Results also showed that subgroups, formed on the basis of presenting complaints and diagnostic criteria (i.e. International Classification of Sleep Disorders nosology), differed in regard to the magnitude and direction of their sleep distortions. Moreover, these differences appeared consistent with the types of objective sleep disturbances these subgroups commonly experience. Hence, the tendency to underestimate actual sleep time is not a generic attribute of all insomniacs. Furthermore, it appears that the accuracy and nature of sleep time perceptions may relate to the type of sleep pathology underlying insomniacs' presenting complaints.},

  abstract = {Since their discovery, slow oscillations have been observed to group spindles during non-REM sleep. Previous studies assert that the slow-oscillation downstate (DS) is preceded by slow spindles (10--12 Hz) and followed by fast spindles (12--16 Hz). Here, using both direct transcortical recordings in patients with intractable epilepsy (n = 10, 8 female), as well as scalp EEG recordings from a healthy cohort (n = 3, 1 female), we find in multiple cortical areas that both slow and fast spindles follow the DS. Although discrete oscillations do precede DSs, they are theta bursts (TBs) centered at 5--8 Hz. TBs were more pronounced for DSs in NREM stage 2 (N2) sleep compared with N3. TB with similar properties occur in the thalamus, but unlike spindles they have no clear temporal relationship with cortical TB. These differences in corticothalamic dynamics, as well as differences between spindles and theta in coupling high-frequency content, are consistent with NREM theta having separate generative mechanisms from spindles. The final inhibitory cycle of the TB coincides with the DS peak, suggesting that in N2, TB may help trigger the DS. Since the transition to N1 is marked by the appearance of theta, and the transition to N2 by the appearance of DS and thus spindles, a role of TB in triggering DS could help explain the sequence of electrophysiological events characterizing sleep. Finally, the coordinated appearance of spindles and DSs are implicated in memory consolidation processes, and the current findings redefine their temporal coupling with theta during NREM sleep. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Sleep is characterized by large slow waves which modulate brain activity. Prominent among these are downstates (DSs), periods of a few tenths of a second when most cells stop firing, and spindles, oscillations at {$\sim$}12 times a second lasting for {$\sim$}a second. In this study, we provide the first detailed description of another kind of sleep wave: theta bursts (TBs), a brief oscillation at {$\sim$}six cycles per second. We show, recording during natural sleep directly from the human cortex and thalamus, as well as on the scalp, that TBs precede, and spindles follow DSs. TBs may help trigger DSs in some circumstances, and could organize cortical and thalamic activity so that memories can be consolidated during sleep.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Sleep is a physiological state that plays important role in the recovery of fatigue. However, the relationship between the physiological status of sleep and subjective fatigue remains unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized that the non-recovery of fatigue at wake time due to non-restorative sleep might be ascribed to changes in specific parameters of electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate variability (HRV) in poor sleepers. Twenty healthy female shift-working nurses participated in the study. Subjective fatigue was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) at bedtime and wake time. During sleep on the night between 2 consecutive day shifts, the EEG powers at the frontal pole, HRV based on electrocardiograms, and distal-proximal gradient of skin temperature were recorded and analyzed. The results indicated that the subjects with high fatigue on the VAS at wake time exhibited (1) a decrease in deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) (stageN3) sleep duration in the first sleep cycle; (2) a decrease in REM latency; (3) a decrease in ultra-slow and delta EEG powers, particularly from 30 to 65 min after sleep onset; (4) a decrease in the total power of HRV, particularly from 0 to 30 min after sleep onset; (5) an increase in the very low frequency component of HRV; and (6) a smaller increase in the distal-proximal gradient of skin temperature, than those of the subjects with low fatigue levels. The correlational and structural equation modeling analyses of these parameters suggested that an initial decrease in the total power of HRV from 0 to 30 min after sleep onset might inhibit the recovery from fatigue during sleep (i.e., increase the VAS score at wake time) via its effects on the ultra-slow and delta powers from 30 to 65 min after sleep onset, stageN3 duration in the first sleep cycle, REM latency, and distal-proximal gradient of skin temperature. These findings suggest an important role of these physiological factors in recovery from fatigue during sleep, and that interventions to modify these physiological factors might ameliorate fatigue at wake time.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Study Objectives:High-frequency electroencephalographic activity ({$>$} 16 Hz activity) is often elevated during nonrapid eye movement sleep among individuals with insomnia, in line with the hyperarousal theory of insomnia. Evidence regarding sleep depth marked by slow-wave activity ({$<$} 4 Hz) is more mixed. Distinguishing subcomponents of slow-wave activity (slow-oscillation [{$<$} 1 Hz] or delta activity [1--4 Hz)]) may be critical in understanding these discrepancies, given that these oscillations have different neural generators and are functionally distinct. Here we tested the effects of insomnia diagnosis and insomnia treatment on nonrapid eye movement electroencephalography in older adults, distinguishing slow-oscillation and delta power.Methods:In 93 older adults with insomnia and 71 good sleeper control participants (mean ages 68 years), effects of insomnia and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (insomnia group only) on electroencephalographic spectral power were analyzed. Main effects and interactions with nonrapid eye movement period were assessed for the following frequency bands: slow-oscillation (0.5--1 Hz), delta (1--4 Hz), theta (4--8 Hz), alpha (8--12 Hz), sigma (12--16 Hz), and beta (16--32 Hz).Results:Slow-oscillation absolute and relative power were lower in the insomnia group compared with controls. There were no group differences in delta power. Insomnia was also associated with elevated 4--32 Hz absolute and relative power. After cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, absolute sigma and beta activity decreased.Conclusions:Deficits in slow-wave activity in insomnia are specific to the slow-oscillation. Elevated high frequency activity is reduced for sigma and beta power following cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia . These findings inform the pathophysiology of insomnia, including the mechanisms underlying cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in older adults.Citation:Hogan SE, Delgado GM, Hall MH, et al.

Furthermore, we tried to explore how these symptoms relate to alertness, depressive symptoms and illness intrusiveness. In a prospective observational study, 283 sleep-disordered patients referred to a hospital-based sleep laboratory for various indications over a 1-year period were evaluated vis-{\`a}-vis fatigue and sleepiness. All patients completed five subjective questionnaires, underwent objective sleep recording and attended a clinical interview with a sleep specialist. The subjective questionnaires included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Toronto Hospital Alertness Test, the Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. Only 4\% of the total sample was referred to the sleep clinic due to a complaint of excessive fatigue compared with 17\% for excessive daytime sleepiness. However, during the assessment, 64\% of referred patients reported pathological fatigue without overlap of sleepiness and only 4\% reported pathological sleepiness without overlap of fatigue. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated a weak association (r = 0.18) between subjective fatigue and sleepiness in the total sample. Analysis of variance testing showed strong association between those patients with prominent fatigue and depressive symptoms (P {$<$} 0.01) and illness intrusiveness (P {$<$} 0.001). The findings support the notion that subjective fatigue and sleepiness can be independent manifestations of sleep disorders. Furthermore, predominantly fatigued individuals with sleep disorders seem vulnerable to additional negative consequences due to possible interplay between amplified fatigue and psychological distress.},

We collected overnight sleep data via polysomnography (PSG), subjective sleep data via a morning questionnaire (self-evaluated) and MSLT data via four 20-min naps over 8 h. Subjects included 122 PIPs and 48 GSCs. Sleep perception was calculated as subjective sleep time/objective sleep time {\texttimes} 100\%. PIPs showed a significant difference (P {$<$} 0.001) between sleep time, as determined by PSG (387.8 {\textpm} 100 min) and self-report (226.3 {\textpm} 160 min), but no difference was obtained for GSCs (440.6 {\textpm} 53 versus 435.4 {\textpm} 65 min). The means for sleep perception were 56.4 {\textpm} 38.8\% for the PIPs and 99.3 {\textpm} 13.6\% for the GSCs (P {$<$} 0.001). In the PIPs group, weak but statistically significant negative correlations (r: -0.20 to -0.25) were found for MSLT versus sleep perception and versus self- and PSG-evaluated sleep time. Compared to PIPs with low scores on the MSLT, those with high scores had less sleep perception (\%), less self- and PSG-evaluated sleep time and greater sleep misperception time. GSCs did not show significant correlations between MSLT and sleep measures or differences in comparisons between individuals with high and low scores on the MSLT. These results add novel data to the literature by suggesting that 24-h hyperarousal potentially plays a key role in the pathophysiological issues of insomnia.},

  abstract = {Several recent results show that sleep and sleep regulation are not only global phenomena encompassing the entire brain, but have local features. It is well established that slow-wave activity [SWA; mean electroencephalographic (EEG) power density in the 0.75--4.0 Hz band] in non--rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is a function of the prior history of sleep and wakefulness. SWA is thought to reflect the homeostatic component of the two-process model of sleep regulation. According to this model, originally formulated for the rat and later extended to human sleep, the timing and structure of sleep are determined by the interaction of a homeostatic Process S and a circadian process. Our aim was to investigate the dynamics of SWA in the EEG of two brain regions (frontal and occipital cortex) after sleep deprivation (SD) in two of the mice strains most often used in gene targeting. C57BL/6J (n = 9) and 129/Ola (n = 8) were recorded during a 24-h baseline day, 6-h SD, and 18-h recovery. Both derivations showed a significant increase in SWA in NREM sleep after SD in both strains. In the first hour of recovery, SWA was enhanced more in the frontal derivation than in the occipital derivation and showed a faster decline. This difference resulted in a lower value for the time constant for the decrease of SWA in the frontal derivation (frontal: 10.9 {\textpm} 2.1 and 6.8 {\textpm} 0.9 h in Ola and C57, respectively; occipital: 16.6 {\textpm} 2.1 and 14.1 {\textpm} 1.5 h; P {$<$} 0.02; for each of the strains; paired t-test). Neither time constant differed significantly between the strains. The subdivision of SWA into a slower and faster band (0.75--2.5 Hz and 2.75--4.0 Hz) further highlighted regional differences in the effect of SD. The lower frequency band had a higher initial value in the frontal derivation than in the occipital derivation in both strains. Moreover, in the higher frequency band a prominent reversal took place so that power in the frontal derivation fell below the occipital values in both strains. Thus our results indicate that there may be differences in the brain in the effects of SD on SWA in mice, suggesting regional differences in the dynamics of the homeostatic component of sleep regulation. The data support the hypothesis that sleep has local, use- or waking-dependent features that are reflected in the EEG, as has been shown for humans and the laboratory rat.},

During much of sleep, cortical neurons undergo slow oscillations in membrane potential, which appear in electroencephalograms as slow wave activity (SWA) of {$<$}4\,Hz1. The amount of SWA is homeostatically regulated, increasing after wakefulness and returning to baseline during sleep2. It has been suggested that SWA homeostasis may reflect synaptic changes underlying a cellular need for sleep3. If this were so, inducing local synaptic changes should induce local SWA changes, and these should benefit neural function. Here we show that sleep homeostasis indeed has a local component, which can be triggered by a learning task involving specific brain regions. Furthermore, we show that the local increase in SWA after learning correlates with improved performance of the task after sleep. Thus, sleep homeostasis can be induced on a local level and can benefit performance.},

A global increase in wake theta activity (5-9 Hz) also occurs. Recently, it was shown that prolonged wakefulness in rodents leads to signs of ``local sleep'' in an otherwise awake brain, accompanied by a slow/theta wave (2-6 Hz) in the local EEG that occurs at different times in different cortical areas. Compelling evidence in animals and humans also indicates that sleep is locally regulated by the amount of experience-dependent plasticity. Here, we asked whether the extended practice of tasks that involve specific brain circuits results in increased occurrence of local intermittent theta waves in the human EEG, above and beyond the global EEG changes previously described.Participants recorded with high-density EEG completed 2 experiments during which they stayed awake {$\geq$} 24 h practicing a language task (audiobook listening [AB]) or a visuomotor task (driving simulator [DS]).Sleep laboratory.16 healthy participants (7 females).Two extended wake periods.Both conditions resulted in global increases in resting wake EEG theta power at the end of 24 h of wake, accompanied by increased sleepiness. Moreover, wake theta power as well as the occurrence and amplitude of theta waves showed regional, task-dependent changes, increasing more over left frontal derivations in AB, and over posterior parietal regions in DS. These local changes in wake theta power correlated with similar local changes in sleep low frequencies including SWA.Extended experience-dependent plasticity of specific circuits results in a local increase of the wake theta EEG power in those regions, followed by more intense sleep, as reflected by SWA, over the same areas.},

Each session contained the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), the Karolinska drowsiness test (KDT-EEG alpha \& theta power), the alpha attenuation test (AAT-alpha power ratio open/closed eyes) and the KSS. RESULTS: Median reaction time, number of lapses, alpha and theta power density and the alpha attenuation coefficients (AAC) showed highly significant increase with increasing KSS. The same variables were also significantly correlated with KSS, with a mean value for lapses (r=0.56). CONCLUSIONS: The KSS was closely related to EEG and behavioral variables, indicating a high validity in measuring sleepiness. SIGNIFICANCE: KSS ratings may be a useful proxy for EEG or behavioral indicators of sleepiness.},

  abstract = {Insomnia disorder (ID) is a heterogeneous disorder with proposed subtypes based on objective sleep duration. We speculated that insomnia subtyping with additional power spectral analysis and measurement of response to acute sleep restriction may be informative in overall assessment of ID. To explore alternative classifications of ID subtypes, insomnia patients (n\,=\,99) underwent two consecutive overnight sleep studies: (i) habitual sleep opportunity (polysomnography, PSG) and, (ii) two hours less sleep opportunity (electroencephalography, EEG), with the first night compared to healthy controls (n\,=\,25). ID subtypes were derived from data-driven classification of PSG, EEG spectral power and interhemispheric EEG asymmetry index. Three insomnia subtypes with different sleep duration and NREM spectral power were identified. One subtype (n\,=\,26) had shorter sleep duration and lower NREM delta power than healthy controls (short-sleep delta-deficient; SSDD), the second subtype (n\,=\,51) had normal sleep duration but lower NREM delta power than healthy controls (normal-sleep delta-deficient; NSDD) and a third subtype showed (n\,=\,22) no difference in sleep duration or delta power from healthy controls (normal neurophysiological sleep; NNS). Acute sleep restriction improved multiple objective sleep measures across all insomnia subtypes including increased delta power in SSDD and NSDD, and improvements in subjective sleep quality for SSDD (p\,=\,0.03), with a trend observed for NSDD (p\,=\,0.057). These exploratory results suggest evidence of novel neurophysiological insomnia subtypes that may inform sleep state misperception in ID and with further research, may provide pathways for personalised care.},

It is hypothesized that sleep serves to stabilize these competitive processes by providing a pattern of stimulation that serves to maintain a synaptic infrastructure upon which wakefulness-driven synaptic changes are superimposed. Sleep is `quantal' in nature in that sleep is a statistical property of a population of neuronal groups in different states. The theory unifies past theories of sleep function yet simultaneously provides a fundamental new paradigm for sleep research.},

  abstract = {The historic sleep regulatory paradigm invokes ``top-down'' imposition of sleep on the brain by sleep regulatory circuits. While remaining conceptually useful, many sleep phenomena are difficult to explain using that paradigm, including, unilateral sleep, sleep-walking, and poor performance after sleep deprivation. Further, all animals sleep after non-lethal brain lesions, regardless of whether the lesion includes sleep regulatory circuits, suggesting that sleep is a fundamental property of small viable neuronal/glial networks. That small areas of the brain can exhibit non-rapid eye movement sleep-like states is summarized. Further, sleep-like states in neuronal/glial cultures are described. The local sleep states, whether in~vivo or in~vitro, share electrophysiological properties and molecular regulatory components with whole animal sleep and exhibit sleep homeostasis. The molecular regulatory components of sleep are also involved in plasticity and inflammation. Like sleep, these processes, are initiated by local cell-activity dependent events, yet have at higher levels of tissue organization whole body functions. While there are large literatures dealing with local initiation and regulation of plasticity and inflammation, the literature surrounding local sleep is in its infancy and clinical applications of the local sleep concept are absent. Regardless, the local use-dependent sleep paradigm can advise and advance future research and clinical applications.},

The purpose of this article is to consider objective measures of the subjective ``sleep quality'' experience. In order to do so, it was necessary to choose a definition of ``sleep quality'' as a basis for discussion. We have chosen to employ the simple Likert-style rating of (the previous night's) sleep quality, commonly included as an item on sleep diaries, as the core sleep quality indicator and focus of this article. The potential objective measures discussed include polysomnography, cyclic alternating pattern and actigraphy. We review the strengths and weaknesses of these measures as well as discuss challenges facing the development of an objective correlate of ``sleep quality'' ratings, including that such ratings may reflect non-sleep phenomena such as mood or health status and the possibility that ``sleep quality'' may reflect different aspects of sleep among people. We also discuss new approaches intended to address these challenges, including: (1) combining different types of measures; (2) sub-grouping individuals based on clinical or physiological characteristics and developing different measures in these subgroups; and (3) sub-grouping based on the association of potential measures and quality ratings over nights.},

Four methods for estimating Delta Decline were compared (exponential and linear best-fit functions using NREM (1) episode mean, (2) peak, and (3) total delta power and (4) delta power for all available NREM epochs). The best method was applied to compare groups on linear and exponential rates of Delta Decline. Results Best-fit models using all available NREM epochs were significantly less vulnerable to deviation due to missing data than other methods. Insomnia patients displayed significantly slower linear and exponential Delta Decline than HC. Conclusions Computing Delta Decline using all available NREM epochs was the best of the methods studied for minimizing the effects of missing data. Insomnia patients display slower Delta Decline, which is not explained by differences in total sleep time or wake after sleep onset.

Three investigators independently assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion and identified 36 relevant reviews. In total, 99 tools were identified and classified into 8 categories. We classified them depending on their category, their publication year and the number of mentions in the 36 included reviews. The 6 most frequently cited were the Epworth sleepiness scale, the multiple sleep latency test, the maintenance of wakefulness test, the Stanford sleepiness scale, the Karolinska sleepiness scale, and the psychomotor vigilance task. Despite the limitation that we may have missed some recently developed tools, this historical perspective on sleepiness measurement is a first step toward a better delineation of the different dimensions underlying the constructs of sleepiness, and will serve as a basis for further discussion in the clinical and research sleep community.},

This slow oscillation is the fundamental cellular phenomenon that organizes other sleep rhythms such as spindles and slow waves. Using high-density electroencephalogram recordings in humans, we show here that each cycle of the slow oscillation is a traveling wave. Each wave originates at a definite site and travels over the scalp at an estimated speed of 1.2-7.0 m/sec. Waves originate more frequently in prefrontal-orbitofrontal regions and propagate in an anteroposterior direction. Their rate of occurrence increases progressively reaching almost once per second as sleep deepens. The pattern of origin and propagation of sleep slow oscillations is reproducible across nights and subjects and provides a blueprint of cortical excitability and connectivity. The orderly propagation of correlated activity along connected pathways may play a role in spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity during sleep.},

  abstract = {To determine whether the spectral characteristics of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) of insomniacs differ from that of healthy subjects, we compared in each of the first four non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) episodes: (a) the time courses of absolute power, averaged over the subjects in each group, for the delta, theta, alpha, sigma and beta frequency bands; (b) the relationship between these time courses; and (c) the overnight trend of integrated power in each frequency band. The results show that NREM power, for all frequencies below the beta range, has slower rise rates and reaches lower levels in the insomniac group, whereas beta power is significantly increased. In REM, insomniacs show lower levels in the delta and theta bands, whereas power in the faster frequency bands is significantly increased. Thus, the pathophysiology of insomnia is characterized not only by the generally acknowledged slow wave deficiency, but also by an excessive hyperarousal of the central nervous system throughout the night, affecting both REM and NREM sleep. This hyperarousal is interpreted in terms of the neuronal group theory of sleep which provides a possible explanation for the discrepancies observed between subjective impressions and objective measures of sleep. Also, it is suggested that the progressive hyperpolarization of the thalamocortical neurons as sleep deepens is slower in the patient population and that this may explain the observed slow wave deficiency. The homeostatic control of slow wave activity, on the other hand, would appear to be intact in the patient population.},

Sleep-stage analysis revealed that morning types and evening types did not differ in sleep architecture. However, morning-type men showed a higher percentage of stage 1 sleep and lower sleep efficiency than evening-type men. Electroencephalogram spectral analysis was conducted in non-rapid eye movement sleep for 6 frequency bands. Morning types had more spectral power in low sigma (12-14 Hz) compared with evening types. The most robust difference between women and men was found in high sigma (14-16 Hz) and was not present between chronotypes. The decay rate of slow-wave activity (1-5 Hz) tended to be faster in morning types compared with evening types (P = .06). This rate was almost identical for women and men.These results agree with the hypothesis that homeostatic sleep regulation differs between morning types and evening types, with morning types showing indications of a higher rate of dissipation of sleep pressure during the night. Morningness-eveningness seems to affect sleep in a sex-specific manner, with men being more affected by their chronotype.},

In this study, we evaluated 1) the extent to which high frequency EEG activity is limited to the 14-32 Hz domain, 2) whether high frequency EEG activity (HFA) is associated with discrepancies between subjective and PSG measures of sleep continuity, and 3) the extent to which high frequency EEG activity occurs in patients with primary, as opposed to secondary, insomnia. DESIGN: Three groups (n=9 per group) were compared: Primary Insomnia, Insomnia secondary to Major Depression, and Good Sleeper Controls. Groups were matched for age, sex and body mass. Average spectral profiles were created for each NREM cycle after removing waking and movement epochs and epochs containing micro- or mini-arousals. SETTING: Sleep Research Laboratory PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Patients with primary and secondary insomnia INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Subjects with Primary Insomnia exhibited more average NREM activity for Beta-1 (14-20Hz), Beta-2 (20-35Hz) and Gamma activity (35-45Hz) than the other two groups (p.{$<$}.01). Group differences were also suggestive for Omega activity (45.0-125Hz) (p.{$<$}.10), with MDD subjects tending to exhibit more activity than the other groups. Correlational analyses revealed that average NREM Beta-1 and Beta-2 activity tended to be negatively correlated with subjective-objective discrepancy measures for total sleep time and sleep latency. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that Beta activity is increased in Primary Insomnia. In addition, our data suggest that high frequency activity in patients with Primary Insomnia is limited to the Beta/Gamma range (14-45 Hz), and is negatively associated with the perception of sleep.},

This investigation utilized high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) to examine topographic changes in slow waves during repeated partial sleep deprivation.

Spectral and period-amplitude analyses of sleep hdEEG data were used to examine changes in slow wave energy, count, amplitude, and slope relative to baseline. Results Changes in slow wave energy were dependent on the quantity of NREM sleep utilized for analysis, with widespread increases during sleep restriction and recovery when comparing data from the first portion of the sleep period, but restricted to recovery sleep if the entire sleep episode was considered. Period-amplitude analysis was less dependent on the quantity of NREM sleep utilized, and demonstrated topographic changes in the count, amplitude, and distribution of slow waves, with frontal increases in slow wave amplitude, numbers of high-amplitude waves, and amplitude/slopes of low amplitude waves resulting from partial sleep deprivation.

In agreement with a recent hypothesis, in the first of 3 companion papers, large-scale computer simulations of the sleeping thalamocortical system showed that a decrease in cortical synaptic strength is sufficient to account for the decline in SWA. In the model, the reduction in SWA was accompanied by decreased incidence of high-amplitude slow waves, decreased wave slopes, and increased number of waves with multiple peaks. In a second companion paper in the rat, local field potential recordings during early and late sleep confirmed the predictions of the model.4 Here, we investigated the model's predictions in humans by using all-night high-density (hd)-EEG recordings to explore slow-wave parameters over the entire cortical mantle.256-channel EEG recordings in humans over the course of an entire night's sleep.Sound-attenuated sleep research roomSeven healthy male subjectsN/A.During late sleep (non-rapid eye movement [NREM] episodes 3 and 4, toward morning), when compared with early sleep (NREM sleep episodes 1 and 2, at the beginning of the night), the analysis revealed (1) reduced SWA, (2) fewer large-amplitude slow waves, (3) decreased wave slopes, (4) more frequent multipeak waves. The decrease in slope between early and late sleep was present even when waves were directly matched by wave amplitude and slow-wave power in the background EEG. Finally, hd-EEG showed that multipeak waves have multiple cortical origins.In the human EEG, the decline of SWA during sleep is accompanied by changes in slow-wave parameters that were predicted by a computer model simulating a homeostatic reduction of cortical synaptic strength.},

The current review provides substantial support for the concept that hyperarousal processes from the molecular to the higher system level play a key role in the pathophysiology of primary insomnia. Autonomous, neuroendocrine, neuroimmunological, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies demonstrate increased levels of arousal in primary insomnia during both night and daytime. In the light of neurobiological theories of sleep--wake regulation, primary insomnia may be conceptualized as a final common pathway resulting from the interplay between a genetic vulnerability for an imbalance between arousing and sleep-inducing brain activity, psychosocial/medical stressors and perpetuating mechanisms including dysfunctional sleep-related behavior, learned sleep preventing associations and other cognitive factors like tendency to worry/ruminate.},

Slow-wave sleep would thus begin with spindle oscillations that open molecular gates to plasticity, then proceed by iteratively `recalling' and `storing' information primed in neural assemblies. This scenario provides a biophysical mechanism consistent with the growing evidence that sleep serves to consolidate memories.},

Their regional distribution and amplitude is affected by brain maturation and by time spent awake, mediated in part by experience-dependent changes in synaptic strength. Recent studies have shown that local low-frequency oscillations ({$<$}10Hz) can also occur in REM sleep and during wakefulness, leading to region-specific cognitive errors. Local decreases and increases of slow wave activity in posterior brain regions have been linked to the occurrence of dreaming and to unconscious sleep, respectively. Finally, the coexistence of local sleep-like and wake-like patterns in different brain areas is characteristic of several sleep disorders and may offer insights into these conditions.},

  abstract = {So-called `sleep misperception' refers to a phenomenon in which individuals have the impression of sleeping little or not at all despite normal objective measures of sleep. It is unknown whether this subjective--objective mismatch truly reflects an abnormal perception of sleep, or whether it results from the inability of standard sleep recording techniques to capture `wake-like' brain activity patterns that could account for feeling awake during sleep. Here, we systematically reviewed studies reporting sleep macro- and microstructural, metabolic, and mental correlates of sleep (mis)perception. Our findings suggest that most individuals tend to accurately estimate their sleep duration measured with polysomnography (PSG). In good sleepers, feeling awake during sleep is the rule at sleep onset, remains frequent in the first non-rapid eye movement sleep cycle and almost never occurs in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In contrast, there are patients with insomnia who consistently underestimate their sleep duration, regardless of how long they sleep. Unlike good sleepers, they continue to feel awake after the first sleep cycle and importantly, during REM sleep. Their mental activity during sleep is also more thought-like. Initial studies based on standard PSG parameters largely failed to show consistent differences in sleep macrostructure between these patients and controls. However, recent studies assessing sleep with more refined techniques have revealed that these patients show metabolic and microstructural electroencephalography changes that likely reflect a shift towards greater cortical activation during sleep and correlate with feeling awake. We discuss the significance of these correlates and conclude with open questions and possible ways to address them.},

  abstract = {We describe a novel slow oscillation in intracellular recordings from cortical association areas 5 and 7, motor areas 4 and 6, and visual areas 17 and 18 of cats under various anesthetics. The recorded neurons (n = 254) were antidromically and orthodromically identified as corticothalamic or callosal elements receiving projections from appropriate thalamic nuclei as well as from homotopic foci in the contralateral cortex. Two major types of cells were recorded: regular- spiking (mainly slow-adapting, but also fast-adapting) neurons and intrinsically bursting cells. A group of slowly oscillating neurons (n = 21) were intracellularly stained and found to be pyramidal-shaped cells in layers III-VI, with luxuriant basal dendritic arbors. The slow rhythm appeared in 88\% of recorded neurons. It consisted of slow depolarizing envelopes (lasting for 0.8--1.5 sec) with superimposed full action potentials or presumed dendritic spikes, followed by long- lasting hyperpolarizations. Such sequences recurred rhythmically at less than 1 Hz, with a prevailing oscillation between 0.3 and 0.4 Hz in 67\% of urethane-anesthetized animals. While in most neurons (approximately 70\%) the repetitive spikes superimposed on the slow depolarization were completely blocked by slight DC hyperpolarization, 30\% of cells were found to display relatively small (3--12 mV), rapid, all-or-none potentials after obliteration of full action potentials. These fast spikes were suppressed in an all-or-none fashion at Vm more negative than -90 mV. The depolarizing envelope of the slow rhythm was reduced or suppressed at a Vm of -90 to -100 mV and its duration was greatly reduced by administration of the NMDA blocker ketamine. In keeping with this action, most (56\%) neurons recorded in animals under ketamine and nitrous oxide or ketamine and xylazine anesthesia displayed the slow oscillation at higher frequencies (0.6--1 Hz) than under urethane anesthesia (0.3--0.4 Hz). In 18\% of the oscillating cells, the slow rhythm mainly consisted of repetitive (15--30 Hz), relatively short-lasting (15--25 msec) IPSPs that could be revealed by bringing the Vm at more positive values than -70 mV. The long-lasting (approximately 1 sec) hyperpolarizing phase of the slow oscillation was best observed at the resting Vm and was reduced at about -100 mV. Simultaneous recording of another cell across the membrane demonstrated synchronous inhibitory periods in both neurons. Intracellular diffusion of Cl- or Cs+ reduced the amplitude and/or duration of cyclic long- lasting hyperpolaryzations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {In this first intracellular study of neocortical activities during waking and sleep states, we hypothesized that synaptic activities during natural states of vigilance have a decisive impact on the observed electrophysiological properties of neurons that were previously studied under anesthesia or in brain slices. We investigated the incidence of different firing patterns in neocortical neurons of awake cats, the relation between membrane potential fluctuations and firing rates, and the input resistance during all states of vigilance. In awake animals, the neurons displaying fast-spiking firing patterns were more numerous, whereas the incidence of neurons with intrinsically bursting patterns was much lower than in our previous experiments conducted on the intact-cortex or isolated cortical slabs of anesthetized cats. Although cortical neurons displayed prolonged hyperpolarizing phases during slow-wave sleep, the firing rates during the depolarizing phases of the slow sleep oscillation was as high during these epochs as during waking and rapid-eye-movement sleep. Maximum firing rates, exceeding those of regular-spiking neurons, were reached by conventional fast-spiking neurons during both waking and sleep states, and by fast-rhythmic-bursting neurons during waking. The input resistance was more stable and it increased during quiet wakefulness, compared with sleep states. As waking is associated with high synaptic activity, we explain this result by a higher release of activating neuromodulators, which produce an increase in the input resistance of cortical neurons. In view of the high firing rates in the functionally disconnected state of slow-wave sleep, we suggest that neocortical neurons are engaged in processing internally generated signals.},

However, because of the absence of standardization, the conclusions that can be drawn about NRS based on the current body of empirical literature are limited. A feeling of being unrefreshed upon awakening that is not accounted for by lack of sleep may occur among a substantial percentage of the population. This experience is correlated with daytime impairment, pain, fatigue, and electroencephalogram (EEG) arousals in non-REM sleep but causal links are unsubstantiated. An immediate converging of researchers toward NRS standardization is needed. We conclude that conceptualizing NRS as a primary symptom of insomnia on par with difficulty initiating sleep and difficulty maintaining sleep is empirically unsubstantiated. We recommend defining NRS as a report of persistently feeling unrefreshed upon awakening in the presence of a normal sleep duration, occurring in the absence of a sleep disorder.},

  abstract = {Introduction Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are the two most prevalent sleep disorders, and frequently co-occur (COMISA) in sleep clinic samples. However, few studies have investigated the prevalence or associations of COMISA in the general population. Methods We used population-based online survey data from 2044 Australian adults. The prevalence and associations of insomnia, OSA and COMISA were investigated according to symptom-level, and disorder-level definitions. Insomnia was defined according to chronic difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep (DIMS; symptom-level), and ICSD-3 chronic insomnia disorder (disorder-level). OSA was defined according to self-reported frequent obstructive events, snoring or doctor-diagnosed OSA (symptom-level), and doctor-diagnosed OSA (disorder-level). COMISA was defined if both conditions were met (for symptom-level, and disorder-level threshold). Associations with other conditions, and general health were investigated with Poisson regression analyses. Results Chronic insomnia occurred more frequently among participants with doctor-diagnosed OSA (22.3\%), compared to those without (14.3\%, p~=~0.010). Doctor-diagnosed OSA was more common among participants with chronic insomnia (10.2\%) compared to those without (6.2\%; p~=~0.010). DIMS also occurred more frequently among participants with OSA symptoms (66.6\%), compared to those without (47.2\%; p~{$<~$}0.001). Participants with symptom-level COMISA reported increased co-morbid conditions, and worse general health compared to participants with symptoms of insomnia-alone, OSA-alone, or neither insomnia/OSA. Conclusions COMISA at symptom and disorder level were common and associated with increased medical and psychiatric co-morbidity, as well as poor general health. More investigation is required to understand bi-directional associations underpinning the high co-morbidity, and improve diagnostic and treatment approaches for COMISA to reduce associated morbidity.},

According to the hypothesis, plastic processes occurring during wakefulness result in a net increase in synaptic strength in many brain circuits. The role of sleep is to downscale synaptic strength to a baseline level that is energetically sustainable, makes efficient use of gray matter space, and is beneficial for learning and memory. Thus, sleep is the price we have to pay for plasticity, and its goal is the homeostatic regulation of the total synaptic weight impinging on neurons. The hypothesis accounts for a large number of experimental facts, makes several specific predictions, and has implications for both sleep and mood disorders.},

NRS symptoms have been less consistently studied than other symptoms of insomnia, and there is no consensus regarding measurement of NRS. Given its subjective nature, patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments are important for evaluating NRS symptom severity and treatment-related changes. The objective of this literature review was to identify PROs used in insomnia populations that purport to measure NRS, and to evaluate their psychometric characteristics. Methods A comprehensive review of PRO instruments used in insomnia was conducted; instruments were reviewed for NRS content by two independent reviewers; a total of 26 instruments identified to contain NRS content were retained for further review. Results Of the 26 instruments reviewed, 23 contained at least one item evaluating subjective nighttime aspects of NRS; 17 contained at least one item evaluating daytime aspects of NRS. Only the Sleep Assessment Questionnaire contained a specific NRS domain score. However, little published evidence was available regarding measurement properties of the NRS domain in insomnia populations. Conclusions There is currently no reliable and well-validated PRO instrument available for specifically evaluating NRS symptom severity and response to interventions in insomnia populations. Reliable and valid measurement tools are needed to measure the symptom of NRS in insomnia.},

  abstract = {Until recently, the association of chronic insomnia with significant medical morbidity was not established and its diagnosis was based solely on subjective complaints. We present evidence that insomnia with objective short sleep duration is the most biologically severe phenotype of the disorder, as it is associated with cognitive-emotional and cortical arousal, activation of both limbs of the stress system, and a higher risk for hypertension, impaired heart rate variability, diabetes, neurocognitive impairment, and mortality. Also, it appears that objective short sleep duration is a biological marker of genetic predisposition to chronic insomnia. In contrast, insomnia with objective normal sleep duration is associated with cognitive-emotional and cortical arousal and sleep misperception but not with signs of activation of both limbs of the stress system or medical complications. Furthermore, the first phenotype is associated with unremitting course, whereas the latter is more likely to remit. We propose that short sleep duration in insomnia is a reliable marker of the biological severity and medical impact of the disorder. Objective measures of sleep obtained in the home environment of the patient would become part of the routine assessment of insomnia patients in a clinician's office setting. We speculate that insomnia with objective short sleep duration has primarily biological roots and may respond better to biological treatments, whereas insomnia with objective normal sleep duration has primarily psychological roots and may respond better to psychological interventions alone.},

  abstract = {Plastic changes occurring during wakefulness aid in the acquisition and consolidation of memories. For some memories, further consolidation requires sleep, but whether plastic processes during wakefulness and sleep differ is unclear. We show that, in rat cortex and hippocampus, GluR1-containing AMPA receptor (AMPAR) levels are high during wakefulness and low during sleep, and changes in the phosphorylation states of AMPARs, CamKII and GSK3{$\beta$} are consistent with synaptic potentiation during wakefulness and depression during sleep. Furthermore, slope and amplitude of cortical evoked responses increase after wakefulness, decrease after sleep and correlate with changes in slow-wave activity, a marker of sleep pressure. Changes in molecular and electrophysiological indicators of synaptic strength are largely independent of the time of day. Finally, cortical long-term potentiation can be easily induced after sleep, but not after wakefulness. Thus, wakefulness appears to be associated with net synaptic potentiation, whereas sleep may favor global synaptic depression, thereby preserving an overall balance of synaptic strength.},

  abstract = {In an awake state, neurons in the cerebral cortex fire irregularly and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings display low-amplitude, high-frequency fluctuations. During sleep, neurons oscillate between `on' periods, when they fire as in an awake brain, and `off' periods, when they stop firing altogether and the EEG displays high-amplitude slow waves. However, what happens to neuronal firing after a long period of being awake is not known. Here we show that in freely behaving rats after a long period in an awake state, cortical neurons can go briefly `offline' as in sleep, accompanied by slow waves in the local EEG. Neurons often go offline in one cortical area but not in another, and during these periods of `local sleep', the incidence of which increases with the duration of the awake state, rats are active and display an `awake' EEG. However, they are progressively impaired in a sugar pellet reaching task. Thus, although both the EEG and behaviour indicate wakefulness, local populations of neurons in the cortex may be falling asleep, with negative consequences for performance.},

  abstract = {TO investigate the brain topography of the human sleep EEG along the antero-posterior axis, spectra (0.25--25 Hz; 1 Hz bins) were computed from all-night EEG recordings (n = 20 subjects) obtained from an anterior (F3-C3) and a posterior (P3-O1) derivation. State-dependent and frequency-dependent topographic differences were observed. In non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, power in the anterior derivation was higher than in the posterior derivation in the 2 Hz bin, and lower in the 4--10 Hz bins. In REM sleep, a posterior dominance was present in most bins below 18 Hz. The 2--6 Hz bins exhibited an antero-posterior shift of power over consecutive non-REM sleep episodes. Consistent shifts of power were also present within non-REM sleep episodes. The results suggest that anterior and posterior cortical regions may be differently involved in the sleep process.},

  abstract = {Background There is a dearth of data on the longitudinal course and outcome of non-restorative sleep (NRS). Methods A total of 2291 middle-aged adults (mean [SD]=46.3 [5.1] years old, 50.0\% males at follow-up) were recruited into a 5-year follow-up study. NRS was defined as morning unfreshness after getting up ⩾3times/week over the past 12months. Socio-demographics, other concurrent sleep complaints, and daytime symptoms were measured at baseline. Chronic medical problems in the past one year were additionally assessed at follow up. Results Several sleep problems (including other insomnia subtypes, snoring, and nightmares) and daytime symptoms were strongly associated with NRS at baseline. NRS had considerable persistence (31.9\%), partial remission (22.7\%), and incidence rate (5.2\%). New incidence of NRS was predicted by female gender (AOR=1.67), preferring not to get up in the morning (AOR=1.96), fatigue (AOR=2.18), and short sleep duration (AOR=1.87), whereas persistence of NRS was predicted by difficulty initiating sleep (AOR=2.36). In the fully adjusted models, baseline NRS was significantly associated with multiple medical disorders at follow-up, including frequent allergic rhinitis (AOR=1.62) and laryngopharyngitis (AOR=2.47), diabetes mellitus (AOR=2.63), gastroesophageal reflux disease (AOR=2.03), eye problems (AOR=2.45), eczema (AOR=2.18), and poor mental health (AOR=1.68). Conclusions The persistent course and independent association of NRS with adverse medical and mental outcomes argue for a distinct nosological status and the need for rigorous medical attention.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that nonrestorative sleep (NRS) symptoms may be distinct from nocturnal insomnia symptoms (NIS). However, there is limited information on the demographic, medical, and biologic correlates of NRS independent from NIS in the general population. This report presents the sociodemographic correlates, patterns of comorbidity with other sleep and physical disorders, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and general productivity associated with NIS and NRS in a nationally representative sample of US adults.National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).The 2005-2008 surveys of the general population in the United States.There were 10,908 individuals (20 years or older)N/A.Respondents were classified by the presence or absence of NIS and NRS. Compared with those without insomnia symptoms, respondents with NIS were older and had lower family income and educational levels than those with NRS. In addition, there was a significant association between NIS and cardiovascular disease, whereas NRS was associated with other primary sleep disorders (including habitual snoring, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome), respiratory diseases (emphysema and chronic bronchitis), thyroid disease, and cancer as well as increased CRP levels. In addition, the study participants with NRS only reported poorer scores on the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) than those without insomnia symptoms or those with NIS only.These findings suggest that there are substantial differences between NIS and NRS in terms of sociodemographic factors, comorbidity with other sleep and physical disorders, increased CRP level, and functional impairment. An inflammatory response might play a unique role in the pathogenesis of NRS.},

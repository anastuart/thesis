# Introduction

## Problem statement

Non-restorative sleep (NRS) is a condition characterised 
by unrefreshing sleep upon awakening despite normal sleep duration and 
architecture as measured by polysomnography (PSG), leading to excessive 
daytime fatigue and significant daytime functional impairment [@roth2010]. 
Despite the significant impact of this condition, it is poorly diagnosed and 
not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 
[@americanpsychiatricassociation2022], with no established guidelines for 
clinical management. 
This population has previously been clinically managed as a subtype of insomnia 
disorder (ID) despite evidence suggesting the disorder is phenotypically 
distinct, with different underlying aetiology. 
Although this population has normal sleep parameters as 
measured by traditional PSG methodologies, new technologies and techniques such 
as HD-EEG and spectral analysis enable exploration of the underlying neural 
mechanisms in greater resolution, which may reveal differences in sleep processes 
that result in non-restorative sleep. 

```Combined, these results suggest that EEG spectral power during sleep, in contrast to standard polysomnography, may provide a better biomarker distinguishing insomnia subtypes, relate to subjective insomnia symptoms and provide more informative with regard to personalised care in ID.```

A potential reason for the lack of restorative sleep experienced by this 
population may be a dysfunction in slow wave activity (SWA), which is the 
strongest established marker of reduced sleep pressure [@tononi2008]. 
Low SWA power during sleep leads to ineffective dissipation of accumulated 
sleep pressure, while increased SWA in wake is associated with increased 
feelings of sleepiness. Subjective sleepiness is **important because of why**

In order to explore if NRS is a result of dysfunctions in SWA processes during 
sleep and wake in comparison to healthy populations and those with ID, 
this study will high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) 
to examine the power and topographic variance of SWA during resting wake and 
sleep. Additionally, it will examine if there are group differences in the 
correlation between subjective sleepiness and SWA following sleep. 

# Introduction to sleep disorders

## Insomnia disorder

ID is the most common sleep disorder in Australia, affecting approximately 33% 
of the population and causing a significant health burden [@sweetman2021]. 
It is characterised by complaints of shortened overnight sleep, 
difficulty with sleep initiation, and frequent overnight arousals causing 
clinically significant distress or dysfunction in daily life 
[@americanpsychiatricassociation2022]. 
In contrast to many other sleep disorders that are diagnosed through PSG 
data, diagnosis of insomnia is recommended based on subjective reports of 
impairment through self-assessed questionnaires 
[@americanacademyofsleepmedicine2005]. However, this has led to high 
heterogenaity within the population, and there is a need for greater use of 
objective measures in diagnosis to better understand the underlying mechanisms 
of the disorder. 

The hyperarousal model of insomnia proposes increased physiological and 
neurobiological arousal has a causal role in creating sleep initation and 
maintenance [@reimann2010]. 
EEG studies have demonstrated decreased SWA [@kao2021] and increased fast frequency band 
activity [@merica1998; @hogan2020] during NREM sleep in comparison to healthy controls.
These dysfunctions lead to an inability to effectively dissipate sleep pressure 
throughout the night [@lunsford-avery2021]. 
Additionally, high frequency activity is associated with poorer subjective sleep 
quality [@perlis2001]. 
This persistent arousal prevents normal sleep architecture and causes increased 
micro-arousals and awakenings during the night, leading to the symptoms 
characterising ID. 

Patients with ID experience excessive daytime sleepiness, however the mecanisms 
through which they are affected vary. 


Literature has found discordant results on how insomnia affects excessive 
daytime sleepiness. Individuals with ID often report excessive daytime 
sleepiness *>10 ESS* [@hein2017], **and other things associated with subjective 
daytime drowsiness**. Additionally, they experience reduced sleep latency in 
comparison to healthy controls [@roehrs2011; haung2012], 
**but why can they not sleep at night?** 

## Non-restorative sleep

Although both conditions are characterised by complaints of inadequate sleep, 
NRS is distinct from ID due to having a normal sleep duration and architecture 
as measured by PSG [@roth2010]. Patients have a primary complaint of sleep 
being subjectively unrefreshing or unrestorative without the presence of another 
sleep disorder [@stone2008].

Daytime impairments associated with NRS include significant daytime fatigue, 
reduced cognitive performance, and reduced psychological well-being, leading to 
reduced quality of life and impaired daily function [@cite]. Despite the 
debilitating effects of this condition, the condition was removed in the DSM-5, 
meaning the condition is not clinically managed. As there are significant 
differences between NRS and ID regarding sleep architecture, functional 
impairment, and longitudinal course [@kao2021; @zhang2013], it is important to 
clearly distinguish between the two groups. 

**variation in definition of NRS leads to impairment of research and clinical management [@stone2008]**.
Prevalence in range of 1.4-35% across studies and populations [@zhang2012] (this 
paper has good references) although variation in definitions and a lack of a 
validated measure poses an issue for classification. 

Although this population has normal sleep duration, unrefreshing sleep may be 
a consequence of disruptions in physiological processes occurring during 
slow-wave sleep, which are critical for neural function [@kao2021; @tononi2006]. 

As current PSG techniques cannot reliably identify NRS through PSG data, 
they may be insufficient for accurately recording the deficiencies occurring 
specific to individuals with NRS. NRS patients exhibit lower non-rapid 
eye movement (NREM) delta power compared to healthy controls, despite having 
similar objective sleep durations [@kao2021]. **second sentence contradicts first**

The lack of a clear diagnostic criteria and omission in the DSM-5 means that 
reporting prevalence rates is difficult, and patients are unable to be 
reliably phenotyped or classified **improve clarity of this sentence**. 

# Mechanisms of sleep

## Neurophysiological correlates of sleep

Sleep is behaviourally defined as a reversible reduction in responsiveness to 
external stimuli, accompanied with measurable brain activity patterns [@cirelli2008]. 
The neurophysiological correlates of sleep and wake in humans can be measured 
through EEG recordings of brain activity patterns, providing a spatiotemporally 
integrated recording of neuronal signals across the cortical surface [@buzsaki2012].
Wakefulness is characterised through low amplitude, high frequency signals in 
beta and alpha frequencies, accompanied by irregular muscle activity recorded 
electromyogram (EMG). Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is characterised by 
reduced muscle movement and the appearance of high-amplitude slow oscillations 
of delta frequency (0.5-4 Hz), deemed slow wave activity (SWA). 
Sleep progresses through cycles of brain activity throughout the night, 
with the greatest prevalence of SWA appearing in N3 sleep [@achermann2003].

## Sleep homeostasis

Sleep is regulated by both a homeostatic and circadian system, 
wherein the homeostatic system increases the level of perceived sleepiness as 
waking time increases, while the circadian system regulates internal synchrony 
with the environment [@borbely1982].
The homeostatic system determines the quantity and intensity of sleep, 
creating an accumulation of perceived sleepiness deemed "sleep pressure" [@borbely2016].
Sleep pressure increases in proportion to the duration and intensity of the 
waking episode, evident through increased sleep duration and sleep intensity 
[@benington2000; @borbely1982]. 
Sleep pressure can be measured through SWA, being greatest during the first 
period of N3 sleep and dissipating in response to sleep duration [@cite]

Sleep homeostasis dysfunction may be a causal factor in the 
impairments observed in ID and NRS patients [@pigeon2006; @cite]. 
In patients with insomnia with short sleep duration, there is a 
global reduction in SWA, while insomnia patients with normal sleep duration as 
measured by PSG can have either reduced delta power or normal delta power [@kao2021]. 
Overnight SWA has not previously been examined in a NRS population. 

## SWA

Slow waves are synchronised neuronal oscillations of membrane potential between 
hyperpolarised and depolarised states originating in thalamocortical loops 
which propagate through the brain [@steriade2001; @achermann2003]. 
Although the precise function of SWA remains unclear, it 
appears to be critical for cellular maintenance and repair, allowing neurons to 
reverse minor cellular damage before it becomes irreversible [@vyazovskiy2013].
The frequency, amplitude and spatial topography of SWA is additionally 
influenced by sleep homeostasis, creating measurable variations in 
underlying neuronal activity [@krueger2019]. 
Increased sleep pressure leads to longer periods of hyperpolarisation and greater 
synchrony between brain regions, which are reduced as sleep pressure dissipates 
[@vyazovskiy2011]. 
Increased synchrony can be measured using HD-EEG through cluster analysis, 
which provides greater spatial resolution than EEG.

SWA has topographic variance across the cortex, varying in a use-dependent 
manner [@krueger1993]. 
SWA has an antero-posterior cortical progression, with the 
greatest activity in the frontal regions at sleep onset [@huber2000]. 
Increased SWA following sleep deprivation is additionally greatest in the 
frontal cortex [@cajochen1999; @werth1996]. 
Repetitive task performance recruiting functional areas of the brain, 
such as the motor or sensory cortices, leads to increased regional SWA during 
subsequent sleep [@huber2004; @vyazovskiy2008].
These findings suggest that SWA is a localised phenomenon, appearing in response to 
accumulated sleep pressure and dissipating with sleep. 

# Daytime impacts

## SWA in wake

Although SWA is a characteristic of sleep, intrusions of localised SWA can 
also be observed during wake in a use and time-dependent manner in response to 
the accumulation of sleep pressure [@huber2004; @krueger2019].
Rodent studies have found increased SWA in local cortical networks in 
response to sleep deprivation despite being physiologically awake, increasing 
in intensity and synchronicity with the duration of wake [@vyazovskiy2013]. 
Localised increased in SWA have additionally been observed 
in humans in response to prolonged wakefulness, being greatest in the frontal 
and lateral centro-parietal regions compared to baseline [@hung2013; @plante2016]. 
The increase of slower frequency power during wake is hypothesised to be an 
adaptive process of cortical downregulation, 
allowing cells to prevent long-term damage during periods of 
extended wake by engaging in the restorative processes observed in 
slow-wave sleep while maintaining consciousness [@vyazovskiy2013].

Increased SWA is correlated with subjective and objective markers of fatigue, 
meaning it is a variable of interest when examining the subjective and objective 
markers of fatigue. 
The appearance of SWA in task-related regions is associated with diminished 
behavioural performance [@bernardi2015]. 
HD-EEG recordings observed a increased SWA during wake in the 
left frontal brain region following a language task and posterior parietal 
region following a visuomotor task, which was additionally associated with 
increased SWA during recovery sleep [@hung2013].
This suggests that the localisation of sleep pressure observed in sleep is 
also observed during wake. 

## Drowsiness 

Drowsiness can be measured through a range of tests, measuring associated but 
distinct characteristics linked to the accumulation of sleep pressure. 
The most common measures used in clinical practice and scientific research are 
the multiple sleep latency test which measures sleep propensity, the maintenance 
of wakefulness test measuring the consequences of sleepiness, and the 
psychomotor vigilance task which measures sustained attention and reaction 
time, known to diminish with increased sleepiness [@martin2023; @basner2011]. 
However, these measures do not directly measure the experience of drowsiness, 
instead measuring its consequence. As the consequences of drowsiness may be 
create different experiences across populations, it is therefore important that 
the neural activity of drowsiness itself, rather than its consequences, are measured. 

The Karolinska Drowsiness Test (KDT) was developed as a specific and sensitive 
measure of drowsiness that can provide insight into the neurobiological markers 
of drowsiness across populations [@akerstedt1990; @akerstedt2014]. The test 
uses EEG to measure brain activity during resting wake. 
The 7 minute test takes place in a quiet room, wherein 
participants look at a set point for 2.33 minutes with their eyes open, 
followed by an 2.33 m eyes closed condition, and a subsequent 2.33 eyes open 
condition. 
The test has been validated in healthy populations, being a reliable 
marker of drowsiness in accordance with sleep pressure and circadian rhythm 
fluctuations [@kaida2006]. 
This recording provides measures of brain activity across 
frequencies and channels, providing insight into both the level of drowsiness 
experienced and any topographical variations in activity.

### increased cortical arousal in ID

-   [@zhao2021] meta-analysis found throughout wakefulness and sleep, patients with ID exhibited increased beta band power, although such increases sometimes extended into neighbouring frequency bands, increased theta and gamma power during wake, increased alpha and sigma power during REM, decreased delta and increased theta, alpha, sigma power during NREM sleep.
-   ID is associated with significantly increased EEG activity in high-frequency bands (beta/gamma) during g reststate wakefulness, sleep-onset, non-rapid eye movement, may reflect cortical hyperarousal [@zhao2021]
-   no significant differences in waking or NREM sleep power were observed across all frequency bands in PI [@wu2013]

### Differences of brain waves of people with insomnia/NRS and healthy controls

```         
- Increased slowing ratio
- Higher delta and theta power
    - Associated with increased sleepiness and cognitive implications
    
```

## Self-reported sleepiness

 - measured primarily through ESS, SSS, KSS [@martin2023]

Subjective sleepiness is a measure of an individual's self-assessed level of drowsiness, often assessed through self-report questionnaires such as the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [@akerstedt1990; @johns1991]. Sleepiness scores fluctuate throughout the day as a result of the impact of system S and C [@kaida2006] and increased subjective sleepiness scores is linked to reduced cognitive performance [@babkoff1991] and delayed reaction time [@akerstedt2014]. Persistent excessive daytime sleepiness is strongly associated with depressive symptoms and illness intrusiveness [@hossain2005].

Self-reported sleepiness strongly correlates with objective measures of drowsiness (MSLT, actigraphy, [@kaida2006]), however discrepancies have been found in individuals with insomnia **flesh out with more evidence**.

```         
"physiological indices of sleepiness did not occur reliably until subjective perceptions
fell between “sleepy” and “extremely sleepy-fighting sleep”; i.e. physiological changes due to 
sleepiness are not likely to occur until extreme sleepiness is encountered. " [@akerstedt2009]
-  weak association ($r$=0.18) between subjective fatigue and sleepiness in individuals with 
sleep disorders. Analysis of variance testing showed strong association between those patients 
with prominent fatigue and depressive symptoms (P < 0.01) and illness intrusiveness (P < 0.001). 
The findings support the notion that subjective fatigue and sleepiness can be independent 
manifestations of sleep disorders [@hossain2005]
- excessive sleepiness is regarded as one of the cardinal manifestations of sleep disorders and 
often is accompanied by fatigue, many patients with fatigue complain of insomnia and do not report 
falling asleep or feeling sleepy at inappropriate times [@hossain2005]
```

### subjective-objective mismatch

There is a subjective-objective mismatch that is observed in people with NRS [@bianchi2013], however unknown if this persists in daytime drowsiness

## approach

-   why are we doing things in the way we are doing? Integrate with theory
    -   Link psychological construct to approach you are using it to measure it
    -   Operationalise how you are going to measure constructs
-   description of overall research study
    -   what type of study it is,
        -   observational, age and sex matched

## Aim

This study aimed to examine if there are differences in how populations with 
NRS, ID, and healthy controls experience subjective sleepiness, and if these 
differences are associated with topographic differences in brain activity during
resting wake. Using mixed linear models, we aimed to assess if there was a 
difference in the correlation between subjective and objective measures based on
population group. Finally, to examine if delta power is a potential mechanism 
for non-refreshing sleep in NRS, we investigated if clusters associated with a 
higher slowing ratio were associated with reduced delta power during the 
previous night's sleep.

```By examining regional brain activity during resting wake, the study aims
to examine if there are differences in how NRS, ID and HC experience and 
dissipate sleep pressure. Differences in delta power and SWA among groups may
reveal differences in how sleep pressure is dissipated and if there are 
adaptive processes emerging as a result of ongoing sleep deprivation.```

## Hypotheses

1. KSS scores upon awakening will be highest in the NRS group compared to 
ID and healthy controls, reporting higher subjective sleepiness following sleep. 

2. The correlation between KSS score and global Slowing Ratio will be 
significantly different between groups. 

3.Topographic cluster analysis of SR will reveal cluster differences between 
groups. We hypothesise that at least one cluster of EEG channels will demonstrate 
a significantly different slowing ratio power that will differentiate the NRS 
group from ID and healthy controls.

4. For those with NRS, channel clusters with high values of slowing ratio will 
also show reduced delta power in NREM3 sleep.

# Introduction

## Problem statement

Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint in Australia [cite], affecting over **how many people** and leading to **health burden** [@sweetman2021]. It is associated with clinical complaints of shortened overnight sleep, difficulty with sleep initiation, and frequent overnight arousals causing clinically significant distress or dysfunction in daily life [@americanpsychiatricassociation2022]. However, there is a clinical population that experience non-restorative sleep (NRS), characterised bt poor subjective sleep quality despite objectively normal polysomnographic recordings, leading to impaired daytime functioning [@roth2010]. This population is poorly understood and not clinically managed **explain**. 

The inability to identify objective markers of this **disease** through PSG may result from the inability of current methods to adequately measure sleep. 

There have not been any studies that examine the validity of the KSS against the KDT in people with insomnia.
Important to see if there are any differences between the groups. (Why?) 
    - because this could affect how they need to be treated?
    - Could have daytime implications
    
        **what is the bad thing?! there is no DSM category for NRS, not clinically managed**
        **why does it exist? Because we are not measuring sleep accurately enough**
        **solve problem = help people**
        **Come up with a valid reason to do study that is better than it's novel**

## Background

- Definition and prevalence of insomnia 
    - [@sweetman_prevalence_2021]
    - [@reynolds2019]
    - Overview of symptoms
    - Models of insomnia 
        - stimulus control model
        - 3P model
    - Insomnia is associated with sleep homeostasis dysfunction, possibly due to decreased homeostatic drive or arousal interfering with the homeostatic process or its dissipation over the night. [@lunsfordavery2021]
        
    - lower sleep duration and lower NREM delta power than HC [@kao2021]
    
- Defintion and overview of NRS

Non-restorative sleep is a population experiencing objectively normal sleep as measured by PSG, however a feeling of being unrefreshed upon awakening [@stone2008]. 

    - lower nrem delta power than HC but same objective sleep time [@kao2021]

    - [@stone2008]
      - variation in definition leads to impairment of research

    - Definition and overview of sleep-state misperception
      - What are the neural mechanisms?
      - Why is it important? 
      - How does it affect people
      
      **interweave this in NRS, not actually measuring it in the study so perhaps not necessary to describe?**
      **could be mismeasurement, something to do with how we measure sleep and how we measure sleep is overestimating what we know**
      
      **what are the neural correlates? Is it deficits in delta waves? 
    

      Why are we not able to measure sleep-state misperception? Is it an issue in how we measure sleep?


## Self-reported sleepiness

- subjective sleepiness is a measure of an individual's self-assessed propensity to fall asleep in a particular situation. Persisistent sleepiness is debilitating and often associated with physical or emotional distress

"physiological indices of sleepiness did not occur reliably until subjective perceptions fell between “sleepy” and “extremely sleepy-fighting sleep”; i.e. physiological changes due to sleepiness are not likely to occur until extreme sleepiness is encountered. " [@akerstedt2009]
-  weak association ($$r$$=0.18) between subjective fatigue and sleepiness in individuals with sleep disorders. Analysis of variance testing showed strong association between those patients with prominent fatigue and depressive symptoms (P < 0.01) and illness intrusiveness (P < 0.001). The findings support the notion that subjective fatigue and sleepiness can be independent manifestations of sleep disorders [@hossain2005]
- excessive sleepiness is regarded as one of the cardinal manifestations of sleep disorders and often is accompanied by fatigue, many patients with fatigue complain of insomnia and do not report falling asleep or feeling sleepy at inappropriate times [@hossain2005]

## EEG drowsiness

Drowsiness is the experience of moving from wake to sleep, measured most reliably through EEG. 

- alpha waves: This brain activity can be easily identified by its topographic distribution (maximum amplitude over occipital regions), frequency range (8–13 Hz), and reactivity (it suffers a dramatic amplitude attenuation with the opening of the eyes). Drowsiness-alpha activity is typically characterized by decreased amplitude over occipital areas, as compared with the wakefulness-alpha rhythm, simultaneous to the appearance of a slower alpha pattern localized over anterior cortical regions.  [@cantero2002]

- detecting fatigue: algorithm (i) $\frac {\theta + \alpha}{\beta}$, algorithm (ii) $\frac {\alpha}{\beta}$, algorithm (iii) $\frac {\theta + \alpha} {\alpha + \beta}$, and algorithm (iv) $\frac {\theta}{\beta}$, were also assessed as possible indicators for fatigue detection. Results showed stable delta and theta activities over time, a slight decrease of alpha activity, and a significant decrease of beta activity (p < 0.05). All four algorithms showed an increase in the ratio of slow wave to fast wave EEG activities over time. Algorithm (i) (θ + α)/β showed a larger increase. [@jap2009]


### Explain brain waves and how they relate to drowsiness
    - AAC
    - Slowing ratio
    
    
## Slow wave sleep



 - EEG slow waves of NREM sleep occur when neurons become bistable and oscillate between two states: a hyperpolarized down-state characterized by neuronal silence (off-period), and a depolarized up-state during which neurons fire (on-period) [@steriade2001]
 - We identified two clusters of delta waves with distinctive properties: (1) a frontal-central cluster characterized by ∼2.5–3.0 Hz, relatively large, notched delta waves (so-called “sawtooth waves”) that tended to occur in bursts, were associated with increased gamma activity and rapid eye movements (EMs), and upon source modeling displayed an occipital-temporal and a frontal-central component and (2) a medial-occipital cluster characterized by more isolated, slower (<2 Hz), and smaller waves that were not associated with rapid EMs, displayed a negative correlation with gamma activity, and were also found in NREM sleep. Therefore, delta waves are an integral part of REM sleep in humans and the two identified subtypes (sawtooth and medial-occipital slow waves) may reflect distinct generation mechanisms and functional roles. [@bernardi2019]
 - Insufficiency of slow-wave sleep may predict cognitive impairment and severity of chronic insomnia [@li2016]

## Delta power

- best established method of sleep homeostasis - delta power dissipation overnight [@lunsfordavery2021]
- insomnia patients exhibit a slower rate in overnight delta decline compared to HC, not explained by differences in total sleep time or wake after sleep onset. [@lunsfordavery2021]

### Differences of brain waves of people with insomnia/NRS and healthy controls
    - Increased slowing ratio
    - Higher delta and theta power
        - Associated with increased sleepiness and cognitive implications
    - 

## approach
- why are we doing things in the way we are doing? Integrate with theory
    - Link psychological construct to apporach you are using it to measure it
    - Operationalise how you are going to measure constructs
- description of overall research study
  - what type of study it is,   
    - observational, age and sex matched

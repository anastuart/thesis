# Introduction

## Problem statement

Non-restorative sleep (NRS) is a condition characterised 
by unrefreshing sleep upon awakening despite normal sleep parameters as 
measured by polysomnography (PSG) [@roth2010]. It has debilitating daytime 
effects including persistent daytime fatigue [cite], diminished cognitive 
performance [cite], and reduced mental wellbeing [cite]. 
Despite the significant impacts of this condition, it is poorly diagnosed and 
not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 [@apa2022], with no 
established guidelines for clinical management. A potential reason for the lack 
of diagnostic criteria is the reliance on subjective measures for diagnosis 
**and the close association with insomnia?**. As this population have normal 
sleep as measured by PSG, an emerging explanation is that current methodologies 
of PSG recordings provide inadequate sleep state measurement [@cite]. 

Measuring subjective sleepiness and objective drowsiness upon awakening offer a 
novel and effective potential solution for diagnosis.

# Introduction to sleep disorders

## Insomnia with short sleep duration

Insomnia is the one of the most common sleep complaints in Australia, affecting 
approximately 33% of the population and causing a significant health 
burden [@sweetman2021]. It characterised by complaints of shortened overnight 
sleep, difficulty with sleep initiation, and frequent overnight arousals 
causing clinically significant distress or dysfunction in daily life 
[@americanpsychiatricassociation2022]. 

In contrast to many other sleep disorders that are diagnosed through PSG 
data, diagnosis of insomnia is recommended based on subjective reports of 
impairment through self-assessed questionnaires 
[@americanacademyofsleepmedicine2005]. This diagnostic approach is recommended 
due to the variability in objective PSG data among individuals with insomnia, 
leading to the identification of distinct phenotypes of the disorder. **fix** 
The more biologically severe insomnia with objective short sleep duration 
(ID-SSD) and insomnia with normal sleep duration but non-restorative sleep 
(ID-NRS) [@vgontzas2013] **where do we get NRS term from?**.

Literature has found discordant results on how insomnia affects excessive 
daytime sleepiness. Individuals with ID often report excessive daytime 
sleepiness *>10 ESS* [@hein2017], **and other things associated with subjective 
daytime drowsiness**. Additionally, they experience reduced sleep latency in 
comparison to healthy controls [@roehrs2011; haung2012], 
**but why can they not sleep at night?** 

Although some studies have found EEG measures of sleepiness are not elevated 
in people with ID-SSD, 

- cortical hyperarousal model
    - increased EEG band beta power
    

**People with NRS and Insomnia may experience subjective and objective sleepiness differently to healthy controls, which impacts their daily life and functioning. This could affect how they need to be managed clinically, and greater understanding of this problem could lead to improved outcomes.**


## Non-restorative sleep

``` definition, symptomology, burden, impact```

Although both conditions are characterised by complaints of inadequate sleep, 
NRS is distinct from ID due to having a normal sleep duration and architecture 
as measured by PSG [@roth2010]. Patients do not meet the DSM-5 criteria for ID, 
primarily reporting a feeling of being unrefreshed upon awakening, and either a 
self-assessed sleep quality of "fairly bad" to "very bad" or difficulty 
sleeping greater than once a week [@cite].

**sentence about sleep-state misperception?**

The inability of current PSG techniques to reliably identify markers of NRS 
suggests they may be insufficient for accurately recording the sleep processes 
that are specific to individuals with NRS. NRS patients exhibit lower non-rapid 
eye movement (NREM) delta power compared to healthy controls, despite having 
similar objective sleep durations [@kao2021].

Daytime impairments associated with NRS include significant daytime fatigue, 
reduced cognitive performance, and reduced psychological wellbeing, leading to 
reduced quality of life and impaired daily function [@cite]. Unrefreshing sleep 
may arise from disruptions in physiological processes occurring during slow-wave 
sleep, which are critical for neural function [@tononi2006].


The lack of a clear diagnostic criteria and omission in the DSM-5 means that 
reporting prevalence rates is difficult, and patients are unable to be 
reliably phenotyped or classified **improve clarity of this sentence**. 

**prevalence??**


**our inclusion criteria: do not meet the dsm-5 criteria**
  **self-rated sleep quality as fairly bad-very bad OR **
  **more than once a week for PSIQ 5b-5j**
    (waking up during night, bathroom, cannot breathe, cough, cold/hot, dreams, 
    pain, other)

- unknown how to record this sleep state mismeasurement observed in NRS. lack of clear 
diagnostic markers and understanding of the physiological mechanisms. 
**variation in definition of NRS leads to impairment of research and clinical management [@stone2008]**.

misperception of sleep onset latency is influenced by hyperarousal 

# Mechanisms of sleep

### Current understanding of sleep

      how do understanding these mechanisms inform the study's approach to 
      evaluating sleepiness and drowsiness in NRS

Sleep is regulated by both a homeostatic and circadian system, wherein the 
homeostatic system increases the level of perceived sleepiness as waking time 
increases (sleep pressure) while the circadian system regulates internal 
synchrony with the environment [@borbely1982]. Sleep pressure has both a time 
and intensity domain, increasing proportionately to the duration and **quality** 
of the waking episode and dissipating during sleep in proportion to sleep 
duration and intensity [@borbely2005] **check citation**. 
The best established method of measuring sleep homeostasis is the overnight 
dissipation of delta power, most prominent during slow-wave sleep (SWS) 
[@lunsford-avery2021]. 

Sleep architecture is identified through changes in EEG patterns which display 
the shift from wakefulness to sleep, and is categorised into N1, N2, N3 and REM 
sleep stages. N3 sleep is the deepest stage of sleep, characterised by slow 
waves of delta activity of 0.5-4 Hz and increased amplitude of 75ÂµV, 
constituting between 20-25% of sleep in healthy adults **check** [@cite]. 
**sleep architecture is affected in ID through shortened sleep, however NRS **
**has normal sleep as measured by PSG**

### SWS

Slow waves are critical for cellular maintenance and repair, allowing neurons 
to reverse minor cellular damage before it is becomes irreversible 
[@vyazovskiy2013]. Importantly, sleep deprivation is associated with increased 
SW activity during resting wake [@cite] suggesting an adaptive process of 
cortical downregulation in order to prevent long-term irreversible damage at 
the expense of behavioural performance [@vyazovskiy2013]. 

Slow wave activity (SWA) dissipates with sleep, with reduced SWA and decreased 
wave amplitude during late sleep compared to early sleep [@riedner2007]. 

**topography**: 
- SWA power greatest in frontal areas, especially during early sleep or 
following sleep deprivation [@werth1996; cajochen1999]
- Increased frontal slow wave amplitude during N2 and N4 of sleep restriction 
and recovery night relative to baseline, aggregate slow wave increased in 
lateral centro-parietal regions in 1st sleep period across all conditions, 
reflecting a homeostatic response to partial sleep loss [@plante2016]

      How do differences in SWA reflect variations in symptoms?
      How might topographical differences in NRS compared to ID/HC differ?
      What are the implications of this?

### ID and NRS slow wave sleep deficiencies

Insomnia is associated with dysfunction in sleep homeostasis, which may be due 
to decreased homeostatic drive or cortical arousal affecting the overnight 
dissipation of sleep pressure [@lunsford-avery2021].

increased delta power during resting wake as seen after sleep deprivation are 
indicative of an adaptive process aimed to temporarily reduce activity in order 
to preserve neuronal function at a cost of behavioural performance [@vyazovskiy2013].


```         
- Insomnia SSD has lower sleep duration and lower NREM delta power than HC [@kao2021]
- Insufficiency of slow-wave sleep may predict cognitive impairment and severity of chronic insomnia [@li2016]
- insomnia patients exhibit a slower rate in overnight delta decline compared to HC, not explained 
by differences in total sleep time or wake after sleep onset. [@lunsford-avery2021]
```

Non-restorative sleep is a population experiencing objectively normal sleep as measured by PSG, however a feeling of being unrefreshed upon awakening [@stone2008]. **sentence about daytime impairments and fatigue**. This population has lower NREM delta power than healthy controls, despite the same objective sleep time [@kao2021]. A potential mechanism for the subjective loss of sleep is sleep-state misperception, where individuals inaccurately gauge their sleep/wake state [@edinger1995]. However, recent research suggests that it may not actually be a misperception, but rather a mismeasurement of current methods of scoring PSG data [@stephan2023].

### high frequency EEG activity during sleep

- greater power ratio of high frequency EEG activity assumed to give an indication of 'worse' 
sleep and is associated with sleep complaints of some ID patiets [@krystal] **fix citation**
- intrusion of high frequency EEG activity marker of unrestorative sleep [@cite] and reduced subjective sleep quality [@krystal2008]
- brain activities that are intensely active during wake show stronger SWA 
during sleep [@vyazovskiy2013]. 


## EEG drowsiness

Main measures : mslt (sleep propensity), mwt (cosnequence of sleepiness), pvt (psychomotor vigilance task) [@martin2023]

Drowsiness is the experience of moving from wake to sleep, observed through reduced frequency and increased amplitude of EEG signals. During wakefulness brain activity is characterised by low amplitude, high frequency beta waves, with the appearance of alpha waves when the eyes are closed [@santamaria1987]. As drowsiness increases, there is an increase in theta and delta waves. Drowsiness alpha activity is associated with a decreased amplitude in occipital regions and a slower alpha pattern in anterior cortical regions [@cantero2002].

EEG fatigue can be measured through various algorithms including AAC, slowing ratio, and [@jap2009]

detecting fatigue from [@jap2009]: algorithm (i) $\frac {\theta + \alpha}{\beta}$, algorithm (ii) $\frac {\alpha}{\beta}$, algorithm (iii) $\frac {\theta + \alpha} {\alpha + \beta}$, and algorithm (iv) $\frac {\theta}{\beta}$, were also assessed as possible indicators for fatigue detection. Results showed stable delta and theta activities over time, a slight decrease of alpha activity, and a significant decrease of beta activity (p \< 0.05). All four algorithms showed an increase in the ratio of slow wave to fast wave EEG activities over time. Algorithm (i) $(\theta + \alpha)/ \beta$ showed a larger increase.

```         
- relevance to diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders (??)
```

### increased cortical arousal in ID

-   [@zhao2021] meta-analysis found throughout wakefulness and sleep, patients with ID exhibited increased beta band power, although such increases sometimes extended into neighbouring frequency bands, increased theta and gamma power during wake, increased alpha and sigma power during REM, decreased delta and increased theta, alpha, sigma power during NREM sleep.
-   ID is associated with significantly increased EEG activity in high-frequency bands (beta/gamma) during g reststate wakefulness, sleep-onset, non-rapid eye movement, may reflect cortical hyperarousal [@zhao2021]
-   no significant differences in waking or NREM sleep power were observed across all frequency bands in PI [@wu2013]

### Differences of brain waves of people with insomnia/NRS and healthy controls

```         
- Increased slowing ratio
- Higher delta and theta power
    - Associated with increased sleepiness and cognitive implications
    
```

## Self-reported sleepiness

 - measured primarily through ESS, SSS, KSS [@martin2023]

Subjective sleepiness is a measure of an individual's self-assessed level of drowsiness, often assessed through self-report questionnaires such as the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [@akerstedt1990; @johns1991]. Sleepiness scores fluctuate throughout the day as a result of the impact of system S and C [@kaida2006] and increased subjective sleepiness scores is linked to reduced cognitive performance [@babkoff1991] and delayed reaction time [@akerstedt2014]. Persistent excessive daytime sleepiness is strongly associated with depressive symptoms and illness intrusiveness [@hossain2005].

Self-reported sleepiness strongly correlates with objective measures of drowsiness (MSLT, actigraphy, [@kaida2006]), however discrepancies have been found in individuals with insomnia **flesh out with more evidence**.

```         
"physiological indices of sleepiness did not occur reliably until subjective perceptions
fell between âsleepyâ and âextremely sleepy-fighting sleepâ; i.e. physiological changes due to 
sleepiness are not likely to occur until extreme sleepiness is encountered. " [@akerstedt2009]
-  weak association ($r$=0.18) between subjective fatigue and sleepiness in individuals with 
sleep disorders. Analysis of variance testing showed strong association between those patients 
with prominent fatigue and depressive symptoms (P < 0.01) and illness intrusiveness (P < 0.001). 
The findings support the notion that subjective fatigue and sleepiness can be independent 
manifestations of sleep disorders [@hossain2005]
- excessive sleepiness is regarded as one of the cardinal manifestations of sleep disorders and 
often is accompanied by fatigue, many patients with fatigue complain of insomnia and do not report 
falling asleep or feeling sleepy at inappropriate times [@hossain2005]
```

### subjective-objective mismatch

There is a subjective-objective mismatch that is observed in people with NRS [@bianchi2013], however unknown if this persists in daytime drowsiness

## approach

-   why are we doing things in the way we are doing? Integrate with theory
    -   Link psychological construct to approach you are using it to measure it
    -   Operationalise how you are going to measure constructs
-   description of overall research study
    -   what type of study it is,
        -   observational, age and sex matched

## Aim

This study aimed to examine if there are differences in how populations with 
NRS, ID, and healthy controls experience subjective sleepiness, and if these 
differences are associated with topographic differences in brain activity during
resting wake. Using mixed linear models, we aimed to assess if there was a 
difference in the correlation between subjective and objective measures based on
population group. Finally, to examine if delta power is a potential mechanism 
for non-refreshing sleep in NRS, we investigated if clusters associated with a 
higher slowing ratio were associated with reduced delta power during the 
previous night's sleep.

```By examining regional brain activity during resting wake, the study aims
to examine if there are differences in how NRS, ID and HC experience and 
dissipate sleep pressure. Differences in delta power and SWA among groups may
reveal differences in how sleep pressure is dissipated and if there are 
adaptive processes emerging as a result of ongoing sleep deprivation.```

## Hypotheses

1. KSS scores upon awakening will be highest in the NRS group compared to 
ID and healthy controls, reporting higher subjective sleepiness following sleep. 

2. The correlation between KSS score and global Slowing Ratio will be 
significantly different between groups. 

3.Topographic cluster analysis of SR will reveal cluster differences between 
groups. We hypothesise that at least one cluster of EEG channels will demonstrate 
a significantly different slowing ratio power that will differentiate the NRS 
group from ID and healthy controls.

4. For those with NRS, channel clusters with high values of slowing ratio will 
also show reduced delta power in NREM3 sleep.

## Descriptives

964 participants completed the online expression of interest questionnaire, with 352 found as eligible for participation. Of these, 8 were unable to be contacted via email and 161 did not respond to a follow up email.  180 participants proceeded to pre-screening. 145 completers were excluded from participation during the pre-screening and screening visits,  with 44 (30%) being excluded for medication use and 54 (15%) being excluded due to having to age or sex match.

 33 participants were included. Due to time limitations, groups were of unequal size. The final sample consisted of 13 individuals with Non-Restorative Sleep (NRS), 11 participants with Insomnia Disorder (ID), and 9 healthy controls (HC). Table 1 summarises the participant demographics.
 

 
 

## Comparing KSS scores between groups

Analyses were run on R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31).

A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to evaluate the effect of group on AM KSS scores.
For the KSS_AM1 scores, the mean score for the control group was 4.22 (SD = 1.09), for the ID group was 5.09 (SD = 2.17), and for the NRS group was 5.77 (SD = 1.92). The median scores were 4, 5, and 6, respectively. The minimum and maximum scores were 2 and 6 for CTL, 2 and 9 for GID, and 1 and 8 for NRS.
The analysis revealed no significant effect of group, F(2,30)=1.897,p=.168

A post-hoc power analysis conducted in G*power Version 3.1.9.6 reported inadequate power for the given effect size, f=0.356. With a set alpha of 0.05, the power was found to be 0.396.

```huge variance in KSS_AM1 for GID, NRS higher but affected by outliers```

The ANOVA (formula: KSS_AM1 ~ group) suggests that:

  - The main effect of group is statistically not significant
and medium (F(2, 30) = 1.90, p = 0.168; Eta2 = 0.11, 95% CI
[0.00, 1.00])

Effect sizes were labelled following Field's (2013)
recommendations.

## Correlation between KSS and slowing ratio scores between groups

## Correlation between KSS and AAC between groups

## Topography of channel-by-channel comparisons between ID and NRS groups

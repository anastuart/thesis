- EEG slow waves of NREM sleep occur when neurons become bistable and oscillate 
between two states: a hyperpolarized down-state characterized by neuronal 
silence (off-period), and a depolarized up-state during which neurons fire 
(on-period) [@steriade2001]. During up-state, neurons fire at high frequencies
typical of waking, and during down state there is a tonic cessation of firing 
activity in all cortical layers [@steriade1993]

```         
- slow oscillation is a travelling wave that originates at a definite site and travels over the scalp at
an estimated speed of 1.2-7.0 m/sec, waves originate more frequently in prefrontal-orbitofrontal regions 
and propagate in an anteroposterior direction [@massimini2004]. 
 - We identified two clusters of delta waves with distinctive properties: (1) a frontal-central cluster
 characterized by ∼2.5–3.0 Hz, relatively large, notched delta waves (so-called “sawtooth waves”) that 
 tended to occur in bursts, were associated with increased gamma activity and rapid eye movements (EMs), 
 and upon source modeling displayed an occipital-temporal and a frontal-central component and (2) a
 medial-occipital cluster characterized by more isolated, slower (<2 Hz), and smaller waves that were not
 associated with rapid EMs, displayed a negative correlation with gamma activity, and were also found in 
 NREM sleep. Therefore, delta waves are an integral part of REM sleep in humans and the two identified 
 subtypes (sawtooth and medial-occipital slow waves) may reflect distinct generation mechanisms and 
 functional roles. [@bernardi2019]

## ID

However, this has led to high heterogeneity within the population, 
and there is a need for greater use of 
objective measures in diagnosis to better understand the underlying mechanisms 
of the disorder. 

Dysfunctional sleep architecture has a causal role in creating excessive daytime 
sleepiness (EDS) in approximately half of the ID population [@hein2017], 

Hyperarousal may explain the low levels of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)
observed in ID despite dysfunctional sleep architecture.
Approximately half of the ID population experience EDS [@hein2017], and often 
have normal or increased sleep latency during daytime sleep tests [@roehrs2011; @huang2012]
These findings support the hypothesis that hyperarousal contributes to ID 
pathology as a stable construct, rather than just during sleep [@dressle2023].





The condition has high heterogeneity in both aetiology and symptoms, which may 
be due to the existence of disorder sub-types which are not currently being 
adequately classified [@benjamins2017]. 

In contrast to many other sleep disorders that are diagnosed through PSG 
data, diagnosis of insomnia is recommended based on subjective reports of 
impairment through self-assessed questionnaires 
[@americanacademyofsleepmedicine2005]. 
This diagnostic approach is recommended due to the variance and subjective 
nature of impairments and practicality of facilitating clinical treatment [@cite]
however a consequence of this is that all people presenting to general practice 
doctors with complaints of insomnia may be incorrectly classified and treated. 



**People with NRS and Insomnia may experience subjective and objective sleepiness differently to healthy controls, which impacts their daily life and functioning. This could affect how they need to be managed clinically, and greater understanding of this problem could lead to improved outcomes.**


```
-   [@zhao2021] meta-analysis found throughout wakefulness and sleep, patients with ID exhibited increased beta band power, although such increases sometimes extended into neighbouring frequency bands, increased theta and gamma power during wake, increased alpha and sigma power during REM, decreased delta and increased theta, alpha, sigma power during NREM sleep.
-   ID is associated with significantly increased EEG activity in high-frequency bands (beta/gamma) during g reststate wakefulness, sleep-onset, non-rapid eye movement, may reflect cortical hyperarousal [@zhao2021]
-   no significant differences in waking or NREM sleep power were observed across all frequency bands in PI [@wu2013]
```


#### Hyperarousal in ID
Neurobiological hyperarousal in ID is observed through increased fast 
frequency EEG activity during sleep and wake [@zhao2021].
During sleep, ID patients have decreased SWA [@kao2021] and increased fast 
frequency band activity [@merica1998; @hogan2020] 
during NREM sleep in comparison to healthy controls,
leading to diminished overnight dissipation of sleep pressure [@lunsford-avery2021].
Additionally, high frequency activity is associated with poorer subjective sleep 
quality [@perlis2001]. 
Hyperarousal persists during wake, with ID being associated with increased alpha 
power during resting wake, indicating increased wakefulness [@feige2017]. 


## NRS as a disorder

``` definition, symptomology, burden, impact```

As there are significant differences between NRS and ID regarding sleep architecture, functional 
impairment, and longitudinal course [@kao2021; @zhang2013], it is important to 
clearly distinguish between the two groups. 

**variation in definition of NRS leads to impairment of research and clinical management [@stone2008]**.

The lack of a clear diagnostic criteria and omission in the DSM-5 means that 
reporting prevalence rates is difficult, and patients are unable to be 
reliably phenotyped or classified **improve clarity of this sentence**. 


### ID and NRS slow wave sleep deficiencies

ID is associated with dysfunction in sleep homeostasis, possibly due 
to decreased homeostatic drive or cortical arousal affecting the overnight 
dissipation of sleep pressure [@lunsford-avery2021]. 

```         
- Insomnia SSD has lower sleep duration and lower NREM delta power than HC [@kao2021]
- Insufficiency of slow-wave sleep may predict cognitive impairment and severity of chronic insomnia [@li2016]
- insomnia patients exhibit a slower rate in overnight delta decline compared to HC, not explained 
by differences in total sleep time or wake after sleep onset. [@lunsford-avery2021]
```

Despite a characteristic of NRS being objectively normal sleep architecture as 
measures by PSG, there may be differences in the microarchitecture of SWA. 
Much of the work investigating SWA in NRS has been in shift workers who are 
additionally affected by circadian rhythm dysruption which may cause ongoing 
damage to restorative sleep processes. Therefore, it is important to examine 
the effects of SWA in NRS patients with functional circadian rhythms. 


Non-restorative sleep is a population experiencing objectively normal sleep as 
measured by PSG, however a feeling of being unrefreshed upon awakening [@stone2008]. 
**sentence about daytime impairments and fatigue**. This population has lower 
NREM delta power than healthy controls, despite the same objective sleep time 
[@kao2021]. A potential mechanism for the subjective loss of sleep is sleep-
state misperception, where individuals inaccurately gauge their sleep/wake 
state [@edinger1995]. However, recent research suggests that it may not 
actually be a misperception, but rather a mismeasurement of current methods of 
scoring PSG data [@stephan2023].


## What is brain activity?

Although the experience of sleep is often classified as binary, brain activity 
varies in both amplitude and frequency depending on alertness. When the brain 
is highly active and alert, neural activity is characterised by a dominance of 
beta waves of >12 Hz and <30 µV. Resting wake is characterised by alpha activity 
of 8-12 Hz and <50 µV, and is associated with decreased arousal. Sleep onset is 
characterised by the emergence of theta waves of 8-12 Hz and 50-100 µV, with 
a dominance of delta waves of 0.5-4 Hz and 100-200 µV in deep sleep. 
Classifying brain activity into frequency bins enables the analysis of EEG 
recordings into quantifiable categories of arousal or sleep. It is important 
to understand what these waves mean and what they are associated with in order 
to be able to reliably measure sleep or drowsiness. 

## SWA

SWA is correlated with decreased levels of subjective and objective measures of 
sleepiness following sleep. 

      How do differences in SWA reflect variations in symptoms?
      How might topographical differences in NRS compared to ID/HC differ?
      What are the implications of this?
      


## Sleep architecture

Sleep architecture progresses through a cycles of activity through the night, 
and is categorised into N1, N2, N3 and REM sleep stages. 
N3 sleep is the deepest stage of sleep, constituting between 20-25% of sleep in 
healthy adults [@cite]. Sleep
**sleep architecture is affected in ID through shortened sleep, however NRS **
**has normal sleep as measured by PSG**


### Local sleep

Sleep has historically been considered a global phenomenon, however increasing 
evidence supports the hypothesis it is locally regulated [@siclari2017; @krueger2019]. 
SWA has topographic variations throughout the brain, occurring locally and 
asynchronously across brain regions and most prominently in areas associated 
with increased activity during wake

Slow waves have topographic variations throughout the brain, occurring locally 
and asynchronously across brain regions, suggesting that sleep is a bottom-up, 
locally regulated phenomenon [@huber2004; @krueger2019; @siclari2017]. 

The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis proposes that as synaptic connections 
between neurons strengthen through wake, allowing learning and cognition to occur, 
sleep is needed to enable synaptic strength to 
decrease and maintain regulation [@tononi2006]. This theory is supported by 
topograpic variations in SWA observed during sleep that occur in a use-dependent 
manner. 


## Sleepiness and Drowsiness

The accumulation of sleep pressure can lead to the intrusion of SWA in wake, 
which is correlated to the subjective experience of sleepiness. 
As sleepiness and drowsiness may not be directly correlated, 
they should be examined as separate measures. 

### SWA in wake




### high frequency EEG activity during sleep

- greater power ratio of high frequency EEG activity assumed to give an indication of 'worse' 
sleep and is associated with sleep complaints of some ID patiets [@krystal] **fix citation, do not use this one**
- intrusion of high frequency EEG activity marker of unrestorative sleep [@cite] and reduced subjective sleep quality [@krystal2008]
- brain activities that are intensely active during wake show stronger SWA 
during sleep [@vyazovskiy2013]. 

### Differences of brain waves of people with insomnia/NRS and healthy controls

```         
- Increased slowing ratio
- Higher delta and theta power
    - Associated with increased sleepiness and cognitive implications
    
```


### EEG drowsiness

Drowsiness is the experience of moving from wake to sleep as measured through 
brain activity, and is operationalised as the intrusion of higher amplitude, 
lower frequency brain activity into resting wake [@santamaria1987]. 
While alert wakefulness is characterised by a dominance of brain activity in beta 
and alpha frequencies, increased homeostatic sleep pressure is linked to an 
increase in theta and delta activity [@santamaria1987]. 




### drowsiness eeg

During wakefulness brain activity is characterised by low amplitude, high 
frequency beta waves, with the appearance of alpha waves when the eyes are 
closed [@santamaria1987]. 
Drowsiness alpha activity is associated with a decreased amplitude in occipital 
regions and a slower alpha pattern in anterior cortical regions [@cantero2002].

### measuring drowsiness

EEG fatigue can be measured through various algorithms including AAC, slowing ratio, and [@jap2009]

detecting fatigue from [@jap2009]: algorithm (i) $\frac {\theta + \alpha}{\beta}$, algorithm (ii) $\frac {\alpha}{\beta}$, algorithm (iii) $\frac {\theta + \alpha} {\alpha + \beta}$, and algorithm (iv) $\frac {\theta}{\beta}$, were also assessed as possible indicators for fatigue detection. Results showed stable delta and theta activities over time, a slight decrease of alpha activity, and a significant decrease of beta activity (p \< 0.05). All four algorithms showed an increase in the ratio of slow wave to fast wave EEG activities over time. Algorithm (i) $(\theta + \alpha)/ \beta$ showed a larger increase.

## Subjective sleepiness 

Subjective sleepiness is a measure of an individual's self-assessed level of 
drowsiness, often assessed through self-report questionnaires such as the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [@akerstedt1990; @johns1991]. Sleepiness scores fluctuate throughout the day as a result of the impact of system S and C [@kaida2006] and increased subjective sleepiness scores is linked to reduced cognitive performance [@babkoff1991] and delayed reaction time [@akerstedt2014]. Persistent excessive daytime sleepiness is strongly associated with depressive symptoms and illness intrusiveness [@hossain2005].

Self-reported sleepiness strongly correlates with objective measures of drowsiness (MSLT, actigraphy, [@kaida2006]), however discrepancies have been found in individuals with insomnia **flesh out with more evidence**.

```         
"physiological indices of sleepiness did not occur reliably until subjective perceptions
fell between “sleepy” and “extremely sleepy-fighting sleep”; i.e. physiological changes due to 
sleepiness are not likely to occur until extreme sleepiness is encountered. " [@akerstedt2009]
-  weak association ($r$=0.18) between subjective fatigue and sleepiness in individuals with 
sleep disorders. Analysis of variance testing showed strong association between those patients 
with prominent fatigue and depressive symptoms (P < 0.01) and illness intrusiveness (P < 0.001). 
The findings support the notion that subjective fatigue and sleepiness can be independent 
manifestations of sleep disorders [@hossain2005]
- excessive sleepiness is regarded as one of the cardinal manifestations of sleep disorders and 
often is accompanied by fatigue, many patients with fatigue complain of insomnia and do not report 
falling asleep or feeling sleepy at inappropriate times [@hossain2005]

## Power spectral analysis
Power spectral analysis (PSA) is an alternative quantitative approach to the
description and interpretation of EEG data. This method is based on signal
processing approaches (Welch, 1967). The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) identifies
signal amplitude for each frequency during 30 s epochs and quantifies the overall
power trends in the EEG data (Ktonas & Gosalia, 1981). Using FFT the absolute
power (μV2
), relative power (%), and mean frequency (Hz) within each frequency
component in a given time domain (30 s epochs) can be determined. The absolute
power of an EEG frequency band is the integral of all of the power values within its
frequency range, while the relative power (RP) is the percentage of the absolute
power in each frequency band relative to the sum of absolute powers of the four
frequency bands (Yuvaraj et al., 2014). 

## Subjective sleepiness

The most prevalent method of measuring self-reported sleepiness is through 
questionnaires such as the the Epsworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Stanford 
sleepiness scale, and Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS) [@martin2023]. 
Scales vary in their assessment of somnolence. The ESS is an 8 item questionnaire 
which measures an individual's likelihood of sleeping in a particular scenario, 
creating a measure of an individual's sleep propensity which is robust to variations in 
previous sleep and time of day [@johns1991]. 
Although the ESS has been found to be a valid measure of EDS for group level 
comparisons of average sleep propensity, it does not measure subjective feelings 
of drowsiness at a specific time point [@kendzerska2014]. 
In contrast, the KSS is a 1-item nine-point Likert scale of an individual's 
perceived sleepiness at a particular point in time, and is highly correlated with 
EEG measures of drowsiness in response to sleep deprivation in healthy populations 
[@akerstedt2014]. 




# Methods

### average referencing

(net voltage brain potential should be 0) - meaning that in order to accurately measure total brain activity you need to be able to measure enough activity to know the voltage potential differences between the sites) - using average of brain activity across cortex means that you are measuring the activity of the particular electrode

 
Following a visual inspection of the data, channels were rereferenced to the average of global brain activity over the time signal. This allows the signal for each electrode to measure its unique activity subtracted from the global activity at that time point. 

### ICA


ICA estimates how indepedent the estimated sources are
Attempts to make the sources as indepentent as possible
can use components to subtract the artefact from the data
take away the time series signal - remove the component 
weighted components


classifier looks at spatial weights in the time series

Limitations of the approach
     there is no perfect solution to subtract artefacts and just capture brain activity
     If you remove artefacts, you also remove brain activity
     Remove as many artefacts as you can without removing too much brain activity
     trying to optimise weights - may end up with a global minimum rather than a global minimum
     
    The lack of ICA in PSG means that it is contaminated by ECG artefacts - this is a limitation 
     
ICA assumes that sources are stationary 

we are using it to clean the data
cocktail party problem
- cleans the data so that each electrode is only picking up activity that is specific to that area
combines signals in a way so that they combine the activity that they measure and cancel out activity that they do not consistently measure
no perfect way of seperating the the data
      
### Power spectra

- Raw PSD has a straightforward connection to signal amplitude, with channels expressing larger signal amplitudes typically showing larger power, useful when absolute differences in signal amplitude are deemed meaningful (topographical analysis) [@cox2020]


## Process

1. manual inspection and removal of artefacts
2. average referencing
3. ICA
4. concatenate two eyes open channels
5. then apply FFT



## Statistical analysis

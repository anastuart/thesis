- EEG slow waves of NREM sleep occur when neurons become bistable and oscillate 
between two states: a hyperpolarized down-state characterized by neuronal 
silence (off-period), and a depolarized up-state during which neurons fire 
(on-period) [@steriade2001]. During up-state, neurons fire at high frequencies
typical of waking, and during down state there is a tonic cessation of firing 
activity in all cortical layers [@steriade1993]

- slow oscillation is a travelling wave that originates at a definite site and travels over the scalp at
an estimated speed of 1.2-7.0 m/sec, waves originate more frequently in prefrontal-orbitofrontal regions 
and propagate in an anteroposterior direction [@massimini2004]. 
 - We identified two clusters of delta waves with distinctive properties: (1) a frontal-central cluster
 characterized by ∼2.5–3.0 Hz, relatively large, notched delta waves (so-called “sawtooth waves”) that 
 tended to occur in bursts, were associated with increased gamma activity and rapid eye movements (EMs), 
 and upon source modeling displayed an occipital-temporal and a frontal-central component and (2) a
 medial-occipital cluster characterized by more isolated, slower (<2 Hz), and smaller waves that were not
 associated with rapid EMs, displayed a negative correlation with gamma activity, and were also found in 
 NREM sleep. Therefore, delta waves are an integral part of REM sleep in humans and the two identified 
 subtypes (sawtooth and medial-occipital slow waves) may reflect distinct generation mechanisms and 
 functional roles. [@bernardi2019]
